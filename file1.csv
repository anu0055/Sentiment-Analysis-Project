There is a strong runway for sustained growth ahead, led by large scale, strong distribution network and wider financial product suites. The franchise has always been ahead of its peers not only in terms of smoothly navigating the tough economic cycles but also in sustaining superior profitable growth along with pristine asset quality across cycles and its track record is unmatched across the sector. Customer acquisition, higher productivity gains led by improvement in the vintage of branches, sustained cost reduction driven by accelerated investments in technology, and cross-selling of wider product suites are the key drivers for sustainable growth over the medium term.  Outlook The macro outlook is positive, which should support asset quality and in turn lower credit cost in the near to medium term, offsetting higher upfront expansion cost and merger-related integration cost. The bank is confident of keeping long-term profitability metrics (1.9-2.1% ROA) with high teen growth. At the CMP, the bank trades at 2.5x and 2.2x its FY2024E and FY2025E Core BV, respectively.

The development pushed the stocks of HDFC Life, HDFC and HDFC Bank higher on June 21.  At 9:25 am, HDFC Life was quoting at Rs 651.65 on the NSE, higher by 1.24 percent from the previous close. HDFC, too, was quoting 0.6 percent higher at Rs 2,677.

Similar approval has also come for the combined entity's shareholding in HDFC&nbsp;ERGO.  Follow our live blog for all the market action  As of March 2023, HDFC held 48.65 percent stake in HDFC Life.  In April, the Reserve Bank (RBI) of India permitted HDFC Bank or HDFC to increase shareholding in both insurance companies to over 50 percent prior to the effective date of the merger. After RBI's permission, CCI approval is another step forward towards the merger.  According to Emkay and Nuvama Research, the decision by the RBI to hold more than 50 percent stake by HDFC twins in insurance entities is a significant boost for HDFC Life. &nbsp;The management has not quantified the increase in the stake. The theoretical limit is 100&nbsp;percent.  &amp;quot;We believe it should be 50-60 percent. The Street had a high probability of this relaxation coming through. Last year, the management had explained that a higher stake would also mean higher cross-sell,&amp;quot; Nuvama said.  Second, the concern of&nbsp;a possible 19 percent stake sale by HDFC-HDFC Bank (which currently holds 48.65 percent stake in HDFC Life) if the RBI had directed them to keep their stake below 30 percent, is now eliminated. It is now confirmed that HDFC-HDFC Bank will acquire fresh or secondary over 1.35 percent stake before the merger completion, an Emkay report said.

HDFC Bank and HDFC - both heavily owned by mutual funds - are set to conclude a merger in the next few weeks to create India's second-largest financial institution by assets after the State Bank of India.  However, pressure on mutual funds to reduce their holdings or any limitations on increases could be an overhang on the stock of the merged entity.  As per the rules of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), a mutual fund scheme cannot invest more than 10% in a single security. However, exchange-traded funds and funds that invest in particular sectors are exempt.  At least 60 equity mutual fund schemes will see their combined exposure to HDFC Bank and HDFC overshoot the 10% cap as of Wednesday.  HDFC Bank and SEBI did not reply to emailed requests for comments.  SEBI could consider this overshoot as a &amp;quot;passive breach,&amp;quot; implying no deliberate attempt to flout rules, one of the sources said. In such cases, the funds have 30 days to rebalance their portfolio, which can be extended by another 60 days, failing which the mutual funds may face regulatory action, the source added.  Regulatory intervention is warranted if there is a wider impact on the market, which is not the case here, said the second source.  Both sources declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media.  The matter has been referred to the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), according to two mutual fund executives.  Last week, AMFI officials and industry executives analysed the impact of the merger and how much of the stock the industry would need to sell to adhere to regulatory limits, the executives said.  &amp;quot;Considering the regulatory requirement, there will be some mutual funds that would need to sell which will create short-term pressure on the stock. However, with the prices reducing, it will create more opportunities for retail and other domestic investors to buy,&amp;quot; said Deven Choksey, founder of KRChoksey Holdings Ltd, a brokerage firm.  Funds may have to offload 30 billion rupees ($364.9 million) to 40 billion rupees of the combined company's stock, said an executive with a large fund house.  &amp;quot;HDFC Bank and HDFC are fairly liquid stocks and have a lot of demand. This will hold true for the combined entity, too,&amp;quot; the executive said, adding that funds that need to sell will find buyers.  This clause could curtail the ability of fund managers to take incremental exposure to the banking bell-weather, the chief executive of another large-sized mutual fund pointed out.  &amp;quot;Selling to meet the regulatory requirements could be seen by some in the market as a desperate act and the fund managers would not get good buyers at the right price,&amp;quot; the person said. &amp;quot;This will impact the fund's performance.&amp;quot;","Business,Companies,HDFC,HDFC Bank,Mutual Funds",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/mutual-funds-may-not-get-holdings-waiver-post-hdfc-bank-hdfc-merger-report_17081441.html

The merged entity is likely to trade under the HDFC Bank ticker before July 20, bringing an end to the process that began in April 2022.","The merger of India&rsquo;s most valuable lender and the nation&rsquo;s largest mortgage financier to create what could be the world&rsquo;s fifth-most valuable bank is inching closer to completion, with just one key step remaining that investors are watching for closely.  Announcement of the so called &lsquo;record date&rsquo; &mdash; or the cut-off day set for investors &mdash; for the swapping of shares of Housing Development Finance Corp. for HDFC Bank Ltd. is expected within three weeks. The merged entity is likely to trade under the HDFC Bank ticker before July 20, bringing an end to the process that&nbsp;began&nbsp;in April 2022.  The merger is unprecedented in India, creating a bank worth $168 billion and impacting over tens of millions of customers and shareholders across the two companies apart from group insurance and asset management businesses.  A central team, with 3 members from each company, and nearly three dozen committees worked on a business integration plan. Meanwhile, legal approvals were sought from shareholders, banking, securities market and competition regulators as well as stock exchanges with the final nod granted by the company law tribunal in March.  The approvals got done in good time and the integration of technology platforms is at an advanced stage, Keki Mistry, chief executive officer of the mortgage lender told Bloomberg News last week. &ldquo;The target is for the merger to be effective early July,&rdquo; he said.  Final Step  Once the merger is effective, a cut-off date will be announced to determine HDFC shareholders eligible to receive HDFC Bank shares. HDFC shares will stop trading on that date and it would take a week or two for allocation and listing of new shares.  HDFC Bank will allocate 42 new shares for 25 shares of HDFC. The mortgage lender said it will try to time the record date to ensure no gap takes place between HDFC shares being suspended and HDFC Bank shares being allocated to its over 740,000 shareholders.  A day before the record date will be the ex-date which marks the price adjustment between the two merging companies, said Anil Ghelani, head of passive investments and products at DSP Asset Managers Ltd.  On the ex-date, the HDFC Bank share price will adjust to incorporate the value of HDFC. This is important for key stock indexes that include the two companies, as well as overlying index funds and ETFs.  Nifty Indices&rsquo; new rules indicate HDFC will be excluded from any index on the ex-date and the value of HDFC Bank updated. Earlier rules excluded companies from the index at the beginning of the merger process. This changed soon after the HDFC merger announcement as the two financial majors are among the top five constituents of the benchmark National Stock Exchange&rsquo;s Nifty50 by weightage. The exchange did not respond to queries about the exclusion.","Business,Companies,HDFC,HDFC Bank",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/hdfc-merger-nears-record-date-creating-worldâs-5th-most-valuable-bank_17079921.html

The pace of growth in home loans will broadly mirror growth seen in HDFC's home loan portfolio, the first official said, declining to be identified as strategy discussions are not public.  Individual home loans have grown at a compounded annual rate of 16% over the last five years, according to its investor presentation.  The home loan segment is seen as a steady growth business with low delinquencies and has seen a boost since the pandemic.  While the share of portfolio will oscillate based on growth in other segments, the group is comfortable with it staying at current levels, the official said.  &amp;quot;We see home loans as a secured sticky product which can generate sticky deposits and spur lending into a number of home-related personal loan categories,&amp;quot; the official added.  The merger, announced in April last year and set to conclude in early July, will see India's largest housing financier merge with the bank it parented in 1994 - now the country's largest private lender.  Post the deal, HDFC's 7.2 trillion rupee ($87.32 billion) portfolio will be transferred to the bank and make up about 30% of its overall loan book. This includes individual housing loans worth 6.02 trillion rupees.  The housing loan business will not function as a separate vertical, but HDFC's front-line staff will continue to lead growth in that product, while expanding offerings to other retail loans as well, the second official said.  The first official added that credit decisions for home loans will roll into the bank's broader credit department.  RUSH OF DEALS  As part of the merger, HDFC's subsidiaries will be transferred to the bank.  HDFC Bank, whose second-largest segment is its banking business, will raise its stake in the life insurance business from 48.7% to over 50%, and from 49.9% to over 50% in the general insurance segment.  Both transactions will be concluded before the merger and could happen via the open market or through bilateral deals, the officials said.  The Reserve Bank of India has also asked HDFC to sell a majority stake in its education loan arm Credila Financial Services, valued at close to $1.2 billion-1.5 billion, due to an overlap with the bank's business.  While this transaction will not conclude before the merger, negotiations are at an advanced stage, the second person said.  HDB Financial, HDFC Bank's non-bank lending arm, will continue as a separate entity and move towards a listing before 2025, the first official said.  Post the merger, foreign shareholding in the combined entity is seen at about 60%-62%, the first person said.  This could allow the bank to be added into the MSCI index for the first time since 2013, potentially bringing in foreign inflows into the bank.","Business,Companies,HDFC Bank,Home Loans",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/hdfc-bank-to-keep-home-loans-as-focusgrowth-strategy-post-merger-report_17076761.html

PCR improved to ~76%, which coupled with a contingent provision buffer (61bp of loans) should support asset quality. We uphold our earnings projection and estimate a ~19% PAT CAGR over FY23-25, with RoA/RoE at 2.0%/17.7% in FY25. A potential pick up in margins and progress on the merger would be the key monitorables. We reiterate our Buy on the stock.  Outlook We reiterate our Buy rating with a TP of INR1,950 (premised on 3.0x Sep&rsquo;24E ABV). A potential pick up on the margins and progress on the merger would be the key monitorables.

While core PAT at Rs120.8bn was in-line, core PPoP missed PLe by 4.4% due to weak NII which was offset by lower opex and provisions. Asset yields were below est. likely due to loans being booked towards the quarter end. Bank wants to maintain its current NIM, as funding cost rise would be offset by fixed rate loans (45% of book). Retail wholesale mix improved QoQ from 44:56 to 47:53. Retail deposit accretion was healthy (+7.5% QoQ) and its share is now 83% (80% in Mar&rsquo;22). Bank added 1,479 branches in FY23 and this run-rate would continue in FY24E. However, key highlight is bank&rsquo;s balance sheet which is merger ready as suggested by high cash and other assets which in the short term could drag NIM, in our view.  Outlook Maintaining multiple at 3.0x, we roll forward to FY25E core ABV and raise TP from Rs1,850 to Rs1,925. Valuation is at 2.6x FY25 core ABV. Retain &lsquo;BUY&rsquo;.

PAT reported at Rs. 12,047 crore up by 19.8% y-o-y/ down 1.7% qoq. Opex growth was higher led by continued accelerated investments in branch expansion (+9% qoq), employee addition (+4% qoq) and higher retail business volumes. Bank is taking benefit of benign credit cost to sustain future growth. Bank guided that loan growth outlook continues to remain strong. There is no slowdown in demand and strong traction in disbursements is seen across the segments. Margins are expected to remain range bound until the loan mix gradually shifts towards retail.

However, higher fees including TPD and lower credit cost led to in-line profitability, at Rs120bn (up 20% YoY). Overall credit growth for the bank was moderate, at 17% YoY/6% QoQ, due to some pulldown in retail credit growth (21% YoY) during 4Q, with its portfolio share at 46%. However, deposit growth came in strong (Rs1.5trn) at 21% YoY/9% QoQ, after a sub-optimal growth in 3Q on the back of healthy retail deposit growth in the run up to the merger. Overall NIM stood at 4.3% in 4Q, but the recent deposit acceleration may keep NIMs in check as the full impact is yet to play out. We have slightly cut our FY24E earnings, by 1%, factoring-in the elevated costs, but expect the standalone bank to deliver a superior RoA/RoE of 2%/17-18% over FY24-26E. Bank expects the merger to complete by July 2023, once RBI approval is in place which we believe will be critical from the point of view of the merger&rsquo;s structure, including clarity on HDFC Life stake/merger of NBFC subsidiaries and regulatory dispensations, if any.  Outlook Notwithstanding the merger-related regulatory overhang, we believe HDFCB offers the best play on India&rsquo;s consumption story and is also a good defensive bet in current choppy waters. We retain a long-term BUY, with revised TP of Rs2,050/share vs Rs1,925 (valuing the core bank at 3x Mar-25E ABV) and a subs valuation of Rs87/share.
