The consolidation of Housing Development Finance Corp. and unit HDFC Bank Ltd. will create a more than $200 billion financial services behemoth, and the parent will be able to tap the bank&rsquo;s deposits to grow, rather than pile on more debt. That&rsquo;s not all bad for India&rsquo;s bond world as the hole created by the shadow lender may let new borrowers sell notes, helping India deepen its debt market.    The shadow lender is India&rsquo;s biggest bond seller in 2022, with its issuance accounting for 7.7% of the country&rsquo;s total issuance volume this year, higher than an average of about 6% in the last 10 years, Bloomberg-compiled data show. The merged entity will be a bank and is still likely to offer notes when needed to boost its capital buffers and fund infrastructure projects.  &ldquo;HDFC&rsquo;s exit will initially hurt overall sales volume next year,&rdquo; said Jayen Shah, founder of Mavuca Capital Advisors Pvt., a fintech investment banking firm. &ldquo;I expect a lot of first-time issuers, state and private companies tapping the bond market next year as yields stabilize, which may then gradually fill the void.&rdquo;  The merger, expected to conclude in the second quarter of 2023, will give HDFC access to&nbsp;16.7 trillion rupees&nbsp;($202 billion) of funds comprising so-called low-cost current and savings account deposits and time deposits of the bank. That will let it continue expanding its assets, which stood at&nbsp;6.9 trillion rupees&nbsp;at the end of September.  The&nbsp;exit&nbsp;of a debt issuer of that size risks hurting the fee income of bankers who have arranged HDFC&rsquo;s various offerings. In the last few years, Axis Bank Ltd. and ICICI Bank Ltd. have overseen most of those sales, Bloomberg-compiled data show.    For HDFC&rsquo;s competitors, though, the firm&rsquo;s exit may be a positive in fundraising terms. &ldquo;The departure of HDFC from the bond market would benefit its peers as it will give them access to a larger pool of credit,&rdquo; Mavuca&rsquo;s Shah said. &ldquo;That in turn will cut funding costs of other top-rated housing finance companies.&rdquo;","Business,Companies,HDFC,HDFC Bank",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/hdfc-hdfc-bank-merger-to-shakeindiaâs-debt-market_16773671.html

This was mainly led by continued strong momentum in commercial banking (31.5% YoY/9.5% QoQ)/corporate book (27% YoY /9% QoQ). Retail growth too was healthy, at 21.5% YoY/5% QoQ. Mortgage book purchase from HDFC continued to be high at Rs91.5bn in Q2 (vs Rs95bn in Q1). As per our channel checks, vehicle financing too is showing signs of pick up and will, thus, be a key monitorable for the bank (being the leader in the space). Deposit growth was also strong, at 19% YoY, with retail deposit growth at 20% YoY; CASA growth stood at 15% YoY, which led to a slight decline in CASA ratio to 45%. We believe strong growth in the non-retail book coupled with some slip-up in CASA ratio should keep margins and, thereby, core profitability in check. After a slight surge in Q1, we expect the bank to report sequential improvement in headline NPAs during Q2, led by better recovery in the agri portfolio (including KCC) and accelerated credit growth. With the bank sitting on healthy, specific + contingent provisions, we expect LLP to moderate which should, thereby, support net profitability.  Outlook We believe HDFCB will be the key beneficiary of the buoyant credit markets, given its strong retail orientation as well as its increasing inclination towards corporate growth. However, a positive regulatory stance on the impending merger structure and managing the merger without much disruption will be key for re-rating. Currently, the stock trades at 2.4x FY24E ABV (ex-subs valuation).

Discussions with investors on this merger update brought to light certain queries, following which we met HDFCB management to allay these concerns viz. 1) garnering higher market share in system deposits, 2) grandfathering of HDFC&rsquo;s bank borrowings, 3) share of unsecured loans in the merged entity, 4) drag on NIM due to PSL shortfall and 5) outlook on NIM/opex. We believe that faster deposit accretion for HDFCB from a system standpoint may be achievable, while grandfathering of bank borrowings may be permitted. Unsecured share in the merged entity might remain between 11-12%, as mortgage portfolio (higher ticket size) would grow aggressively. Standalone NIM may gradually improve (4.2% in FY22), as share of retail would rise that may also protect NIM owing to lower PSL requirements. Opex could remain elevated over the medium term. As we slightly raise NII for FY24E/25E, our PAT increases by average 2.5%.  Outlook Hence we raise SOTP based TP from Rs1740 to Rs1800 basis Sep&rsquo;24 core ABV but maintain &lsquo;BUY&rsquo;.

We believe that the runway is huge, and we can potentially add an HDFC Bank every five years.&amp;quot;","HDFC Bank proposes to double its network of branches in the next three to five years by adding 1,500 to 2,000 branches annually, which would akin to adding a new HDFC Bank every five years, said its managing director and CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan.  Outlining justification for merger of HDFC with the HDFC Bank in his letter to shareholders in the annual report 2021-22, Jagdishan said: &amp;quot;The proposed merger adds an entirely different dimension to the future. We believe that the runway is huge, and we can potentially add an HDFC Bank every five years.&amp;quot;  He further said that the bank proposes to nearly double its network of branches in the next three to five years by opening 1,500 to 2,000 branches every year. Currently it has over 6,000 branches across India.  &amp;quot;The density of branches for the population of this country is way below that of OECD countries. This is where our branch banking strategy comes in. Today we have 6,000-plus branches across India, and we plan to nearly double our network in the next three to five years by opening 1,500 to 2,000 branches every year,&amp;quot; he said.  In early April this year, the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and its subsidiary HDFC Bank had announced a transformational merger, which is expected to be completed in about 15 to 18 months. Christening the merger as the 'Power of One', Jagdishan said the bank looks forward to the phenomenal set of talent, deep product knowledge and expertise, the processes, and system that the lender will add to the existing ones.  HDFC Bank cannot afford to miss this opportunity, Jagdishan said, adding that home loans are emotional products and bring with them a host of accelerated benefits for the bank. &amp;quot;Today the environment for buying a home has changed. RERA has ensured greater transparency in the process. Price corrections in the property market have seen inventories come down. Also, rising incomes mean that home loan EMIs have come down as a percentage of a person's income,&amp;quot; the official said.  He said with the penetration of telecom, internet and television services, the desire to own better homes has increased across the country. &amp;quot;All this means that housing is going to be a huge growth opportunity and one of the key drivers of India's GDP over the next decade.&amp;quot;  Putting forth the statistics, Jagdishan said that only 2 per cent of its customers source their home loans from it, while 5 per cent do it from other institutions. &amp;quot;The latter is equivalent to the size of our retail book. Home loan customers typically keep deposits that are 5 to 7 times that of other retail customers. And about 70 per cent of HDFC Ltd's customers do not bank with us.&amp;quot; All these give HDFC Bank the idea about the size of the opportunity, he said, adding that the long tenor nature of home loans provides resilience to the balance sheet. The bank is one of the largest consumer durable financiers in the country.  &amp;quot;We can easily bundle this with a home loan, as with every home loan, there is a propensity of a customer to take new consumer durables. It is this kind of bundling that will increase margins. With the advantage of a lower cost of funds and the phenomenal distribution muscle that we have built, it is imperative that we seize this opportunity,&amp;quot; he said.  Reasoning the timing of merger, he said there are other favourable factors too such as narrowing down of the regulatory arbitrage between banks and NBFCs over the last few years, with the reserve requirements coming down to about 22 per cent from 26 per cent.  &amp;quot;Both institutions are well-capitalised and have surplus liquidity and a strong portfolio of investments in government securities. The increase in priority sector lending that we need to do, due to the merger, is possible now with our own increased focus on MSMEs, the affordable housing loans that we can do and the well-developed PSL certificate market. &amp;quot;All this means that on the day of the merger there may not be any need to raise further funds to meet reserve requirements. The addition of the home mortgages portfolio on our balance sheet makes it more diversified and robust.&amp;quot;  Futher, the enhanced capital position of the bank post the merger also means that the lender can take bigger exposures in leading corporates and power the country's infrastructure build out, Jagdishan said. He said HDFC Bank already had a huge opportunity with the under-penetration of banking services in the country. &amp;quot;The proposed merger adds an entirely different dimension to the future.&amp;quot; He said HDFC Bank already had a huge opportunity with the under-penetration of banking services in the country.  On the capital raise plans, the lender said it proposes to raise an amount not exceeding Rs 50,000 crore by issuing long-term bonds on a private placement basis. It will seek shareholders' approval in the ensuing annual general meeting scheduled for July 16, 2022 for the fundraise plan.  In fiscal year ended March 2022, HDFC Bank reported nearly 19 per cent growth in its net profit at Rs 36,961 crore. Its balance sheet grew by 18.4 per cent to Rs 20,68,535 crore.

The hike, which comes a day ahead of the RBI's scheduled policy review, is the second such move from the lender in as many months, taking the cumulative hike to up to 0.60 percent.  The RBI had surprised all with a 0.40 per cent hike in key interest rates on May 4 to tame the inflation situation and is widely expected to follow up with further tightening of the policy on Wednesday.  HDFC Bank increased its Marginal Cost of funding based Lending Rate by 0.35 percent from June 7, as per the new rate structure published on its website.  The one-year MCLR, on which a bulk of consumer loans are pegged, will be 7.85 percent after the newest review as against 7.50 percent earlier.  The overnight MCLR will be 7.50 percent against 7.15 percent, while the three-year MCLR will be 8.05 percent compared to 7.70 percent.  It can be noted that the rate hikes come at a time when credit growth is not very high and banks are keen to accelerate on the same.
