By the end of the year, there were only three major players left in the market. ","Moneycontrol News  On Tuesday, Anil Ambani-led Reliance Communications said that the telecom sector has become a money guzzler where only those with deep pockets can survive.  Even the &amp;quot;mighty&amp;quot; house of Tatas had to &amp;quot;gift away&amp;quot; their telecom business (to Airtel), Ambani asserted, sounding bitter about the regulatory framework. He said the long time taken to clear&nbsp;RCom's merger with Systema Shyam Telecom represents an &amp;quot;unease of doing business&amp;quot;.  For every telecom company in India that cannot be considered a giant in the sector, the last couple of years have been the same. Companies have had to either pump in a lot of money into their business to stay competitive enough to survive, or merge themselves with other companies. And as if that were not enough, when companies did try to merge with each other, they were held up by regulatory hurdles.  So when Reliance Jio finally arrived late last year, other telcos were left high and dry quite literally. According to a report by Kleiner Perkins Internet Trends 2017, India&rsquo;s wireless consumer data prices fell 48 percent as incumbent mobile operators responded to Jio&rsquo;s pricing.  The Jio effect  As of September this year, the top three telcos in the country had together lost over 50 lakh subscribers, according to a report by Business Standard. Idea and Vodafone had lost 28 lakh and 24 lakh subscribers, respectively, while Airtel's base contracted by two lakh subscribers, the report said.  However, Prashant Singhal, Global telecommunications Leader at EY, told the newspaper that for a market like India, it was the revenue that must be monitored to check a telcos' health rather than the subscriber base.  &amp;quot;The health of industry is driven by revenue and we have to see if revenue is shifting in favour of&nbsp;Reliance Jio.&nbsp;In India, people have got multiple SIMs and losing subscribers does not give a clear indication of an operator&rsquo;s health,&amp;quot; Singhal said.  Both Airtel and Vodafone were forced to slash tariff after they started losing customers to Jio. However, the two companies continue to charge for voice calls and text messages, at least on some of their plans, whereas these services are offered free of cost by Jio on all its plans.  The country's largest telecom operator&nbsp;Bharti Airtel's consolidated net profit for the second quarter fell 6.6 percent, dented by pricing pressure, while Vodafone saw its operating profit fall 39 percent year-on year in the first half of this fiscal year.  Speaking to The Economic Times, Bharti Airtel's Sunil Mittal had said that Jio's entry with prolonged free offers had led to unexpectedly rapid consolidation.  &amp;quot;Market has consolidated to a level which was an aspiration, but never thought would be a possibility. Now we're looking at 3-4 players. Number 2 Vodafone and Number 3 Idea being put together, is unprecedented... you never see two strong companies merging...this is just because the market structure has got completely damaged,&amp;quot; he told the newspaper.  Mittal estimated that around USD 40-50 billion (approximately Rs 2.5-3.2 lakh crore) has been written off by various telecom companies, which he believes is &amp;quot;largely due to Jio&amp;quot;.  However, Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani quickly rebutted Mittal, saying businesses must stop looking at regulators and governments to guarantee their profits, according to a report by Gadgets Now.  Speaking to CNBC-TV18, former chairman of Micromax Sanjay Kapoor said in October that consolidation in the telecom space is good, while competition remains severe.  According to Kapoor, two things are happening in the sector. Firstly, there is clear consolidation in a space where an unsustainable perfect competition structure is dying down. A more sustainable structure is now coming into shape and three long-term players seem to be standing out.  Secondly, he said, Jio starting to publish its earnings numbers will drive change in behaviour of other telcos, considering their revenue steams had been completely disrupted by the new carrier.  According to a report by The Hindu BusinessLine, analysts at Goldman Sachs feel that as a result of consolidation, consumers can hope to benefit from their service providers who are on a stronger footing to expand their networks and improve quality of service.  Indian telecom companies are now looking for mergers and acquisitions to stay ahead of the competition. In February, Telecom Secretary JS Deepak said that the Indian telecom market would eventually consolidate to have only five major players. He also said &amp;quot;consolidation is going to be very good for India as we are likely to get four private and one government player (BSNL-MTNL), which is ideal.&amp;quot;  According to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), there were more than 1.18 billion wireless telephone subscribers in the country in April this year, being serviced by as many as 12 operators.  For the telecom sector in India, 2017 was a year marked by unprecedented consolidation. Here are some of the&nbsp;key mergers and acquisitions of the sector from this year:  Airtel and Tata Teleservices  In October, Airtel announced a merger&nbsp;of its mobile operations with struggling Tata Teleservices. According to the deal, Airtel would acquire Tata's consumer mobile business in 19 circles.  The merger was done on a debt-free, cash-free basis. The deal also gave Airtel access to Tata's 1,800, 2,100 and 850 MHz spectrum bands, all widely used for 4G. In December, both boards had cleared terms for the customer business merger.  Vodafone and Idea Cellular  India's second largest (Vodafone) and third largest (Idea) telecom operators are now in the process of merging to form what would become the country's largest operator. The merged entity will also be the world's second largest telecom service provider.  According to the terms of the deal, Idea's parent entity Aditya Birla Group will gradually raise its stake in the combined entity while the Vodafone Group will reduce its stake until both their shares are equal. The two companies have received regulatory approval and have started picking key executives. They are hopeful that the merger will be concluded in 2018.  Airtel acquires Telenor India and Tikona  In February, Airtel bought Telenor's ailing Indian subsidiary, Telenor India. According to the deal, Airtel took over Telenor India's liabilities pertaining to licence fees and lease obligations for mobile towers.  The deal, which gave Airtel 44 million additional users, did not involve any cash payment to Telenor. Airtel also got Telenor India's 43.4 MHz spectrum in the 1,800 MHz band as a part of the deal.  In September this year, Airtel announced it had fully acquired Tikona Digital Network's share capital. Earlier, the company had announced a plan to purchase Tikona's 4G airwaves for Rs 1,600 crore. The acquisition gave the Sunil Mittal-led telecom company access to Tikona's 4G spectrum in five circles.  Reliance Communications and Aircel  In April 2017, Reliance Communications and Aircel approved a merger that would create one of the largest networks in the country in terms of subscribers. RCom and Aircel's parent firm Maxis were supposed to own 50 percent stake each in the merged entity.  The proposed merger was crucial for RCom as it would have retired Rs 25,000 crore of debt from its total debt of around Rs 45,000 crore. However, RCom shelved merger talks with Aircel, citing regulatory uncertainties.  On December 26, RCom unveiled a new resolution plan to reduce its debt by up to Rs 39,000 crore through prepayment and sale of assets and form a new RCom with debt levels of less than Rs 6,000 crore.  The resolution plan involves exiting strategic debt restructuring (SDR) and monetising some of the company's assets, including transfer of spectrum liabilities by March 2018.

As part of the deal Reliance Jio will take over Reliance Communications&rsquo; 4G spectrum in 800/900/1800/2,100 MHz bands, fibre optic cable spanning 1,78,000 km pan India and 43,000 towers.  While Reliance Communication will use the proceeds to pare its debt, Jio will benefit out of the deal as the newly procured assets will augment Jio's Fibre-To-Home which is expected to launch in 2018. The deal will also supplement Jio in its enterprise operations.  Commenting on the deal Rajan Mathews, DG of COAI said, &ldquo;It is a good thing that it was bid out in a very transparent manner and the bidding shows that, the remaining players are very keen and are now strategic in nature in terms of going forward.&rdquo;  &ldquo;The emerging landscape of the three dominant players &mdash; Jio, Airtel and Vodafone-Idea combine &mdash; is going to be the landscape of the operator community going forward,&rdquo; he added.  RK Upadhyay Former CMD, BSNL said, &ldquo;the move was expected for long and it is a move in the right direction.&rdquo;  The deal with RCom will certainly give Reliance Jio an advantage over Bharti Airtel and Vodafone as &ldquo;their position will certainly be strengthened by acquiring this portfolio,&rdquo; he said.  Former DoT Secretary and NASSCOM President, R Chandrashekhar said, &ldquo;The deal is part of the whole ongoing consolidation and each player trying to have a presence across all the service areas &ndash; both in geographic sense and in terms of the kind of services that are offered.&rdquo;  Mahesh Uppal of Com First India said: &ldquo;The deal is particularly valuable to Reliance Jio as &ldquo;when you try and combine assets of this kind, it is not simply additive, but sometimes even multiplicative because you do actually manage to make up for any kind of deficiencies in your network.&rdquo;  HP Ranina, Corporate Lawyer lauded the deal and said it is a win-win deal for both. He said, &ldquo;Mukesh Ambani through Reliance Jio is going to dominate the telecom sector and that is his whole intention of acquiring this particular thing from Anil Ambani group. Possibly, he will also acquire from other companies in the due course.&rdquo;  He added, &ldquo;Anil Ambani has made a good tactical move and it also benefits Reliance Jio. So, it is a win-win situation.&rdquo;  Former Telecom and IT Minister Milind Deora said the deal is a healthy sign for the telecom sector. He said, &ldquo;Telecom sector has been great for the consumer, the country and for our productivity over the last decade or so. Now, it is time for us to move into a more mature and evolved market as we see in many other parts of the world where you will have four or five large operators and there is bound to be consolidation. So, that is a healthy sign.&rdquo;  He said, &ldquo;There are still tremendous opportunities in India's telecommunication sector, but there is only room for four or five large telcos.

According to Accenture's baseline projection, India will a USD 6.4 trillion economy by 2035, and AI will add another USD 957 billion to, taking the overall size of the economy to USD 7.355 trillion.  &amp;quot;There's strong early evidence that AI can play a key role in unlocking socioeconomic value here,&amp;quot; its senior managing director and chairman for India Rekha Menon said.

Earlier, Reliance chairman Mukesh Ambani had said the country could be a USD 10 trillion economy by 2030.  For its estimate of AI adding USD 957 billion by 2035, Accenture said it has studied the country's strengths in AI across the pillars of universities, startups,large businesses, policymakers and multi-stakeholder partnerships.  However, a comparison with other countries in the G20 grouping suggests &amp;quot;India lags on key indicators of AI development&amp;quot;, it said.

OpenSignal, a London-based firm which specialises in crowdsourced wireless coverage mapping all over the world, said that although Jio&rsquo;s entry into the market resulted in data prices becoming much cheaper&nbsp;&ndash; which resulted in increased number of 4G consumers &ndash; it doubts whether Jio will be able to retain its position at the helm.  &amp;quot;The trend will continue next year. Whether Jio remains a huge dominant driver in 4G growth remains to be seen. After a year of free and steeply discounted data pricing, Jio may make 2018 the year it raises prices. That could level the playing field for India's operators,&amp;quot; said Andrea Toth from OpenSignal.  Since its launch in September 2016, Jio has&nbsp;triggered a bitter price war with the existing players&nbsp;in the market. With Jio&rsquo;s highly disruptive entry, all the telco players saw a sharp decrease in revenues and had to drastically&nbsp;change their strategy and product mix in order to find other ways of generating revenues. Such was Jio&rsquo;s impact that voice and SMS services, which once generated a lion&rsquo;s share of revenue for telcos, are now being offered as freebies.  With data priced at &lsquo;next to nothing&rsquo; on launch, Jio's customer base grew at a dizzying pace. Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mukesh Ambani led Reliance Industries, added a customer base of about 16 million in the first month of its launch. The company crossed 50 million subscriber mark in 83 days of its launch, becoming the fastest company ever to do so.  &amp;quot;Jio's widespread 4G access, along with its at-first free and later heavily discounted data and voice plans, quickly won the hearts &mdash;&nbsp;and wallets &mdash;&nbsp;of more than 100 million mobile users across the country,&amp;quot; Toth added.  Jio not only made 4G VoLTE a household name but also helped transform India's image of a country struggling to develop 4G VoLTE technology to one of the top countries in terms of 4G VoLTE connectivity and reach and the fastest growing mobile market in the world.

","Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani said on Friday that telecom venture Jio is ahead of schedule in terms of generating returns.  Jio has shaken up the telecom sector with its free voice calling and cheap data tariffs since it was launched 14 months ago. Speaking at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit, Ambani countered the perception of Jio destroying the competition by saying that what mattered most is that the consumer gains and the industry moves forward.  Ambani also said that education and healthcare will be on his radar in the future.  Below is the transcript of the interview.  Q: You spoke about the huge amount of investment that you have made in Jio. There have been questions asked in several quarters about your ability to recoup this investment and how much time it would take. Everyone knows how shroud you are a businessmen, so it is highly unlikely that you would be doing things for charity. So, how soon do you expect Jio to turn profitable?  A: Jio's results are declared every quarter now and you can see the trend and watch the next few quarters, you will learn in January and you will learn in March. I do not want to predict, but I think we are ahead of our schedule in terms of the returns that we are generating.  Q: Which should we watch closely, January or March?  A: Watch all the three quarters.  Q: How do you decide how to enter a business? You spoke about all these interesting new areas that are emerging. What are the parameters a business has to meet before Reliance decides, it wants to enter it?  A: The Reliance DNA started from my father when he founded Reliance. At that time, he has ingrained into us that as a business, you must solve problems and the economic value is more a by-product of that. So if you look at the history of Reliance, we started with clothing people, we started with textiles, we went into developing the textile industry, then built our refinery which was really energy security. We solved the problem at that time in terms of India not importing diesel and petrol.  If we look at our own entry into retail, it was linked to the need for employment creation and as our balance sheet becomes stronger, we still look to solve problems to create societal values and now, I challenge myself and our people to solve the more difficult problems and we can take some risks.  So what we did with Jio is really, we put in and not many in the world had backed us. But, as I just explained, we are strong believers that if India and 1.3 billion Indians have to participate in this new world, for us, we cannot always have the data infrastructure 20 years after the world. We would have no chance. Today, we have along with Rajan and Kumar, with all of us as one industry, I think India, in terms of data infrastructure will be ahead of the US by 2019.  So as we move forward, we think about more and more difficult issues that create value for all Indians. I think that agriculture is difficult and that is something that needs to be taken. Education is important. And healthcare is the most difficult. So, we would clearly think about what we can do in each one of these areas.  Q: Follow up to that question, you spoke about creating value for all Indians. It was earlier this week, last week, one of your rivals in the telecom business had an interview in a newspaper where he spoke about Jio actually destroying 50 billion of their value in the telecom business. There is this perception that is there of Reliance entering into businesses and fundamentally disrupting them and destroying the competition. Do you think that would be an accurate assessment of what has happened in telecom?  A: Sunil is a good friend of mine, he is not a rival.  Q: A business rival.  A: I do not think of businesses in that way. The second piece - what he said and what you are interpreting is different. But just to make my point of view clear, I think that for all of us within industry, profits and losses are risks that we take and I do not think that we can rely on regulators or governments to guarantee our profits or losses.  To me, what is most important is do we really move the country forward and does the consumer gain? I think the question as a journalist you should be thinking about is that even if there are profits and losses, who gains and who loses? As long as the consumer gains and the country moves forward, it is worth taking those losses. Some of us are big boys, we can afford that.  Q: This question because a lot of people define you in terms of your wealth. I have seen a lot of descriptions that define you. What does money mean to you now?  A: Frankly, money has never meant much to me. I abhor the labels and the titles which all of you refer to in terms of where we are. But to me, resources enable you to take risks from a company point of view which you would have not done. So it gives you a little bit of flexibility.  On a personal level, very few people know this, but my sister Nina is somewhere in the audience. I have, from childhood, in school and together now, I have never carried money. So I do not have a credit card, I do not carry cash in my pocket. I always have somebody around me who pays for me. So that works.  Q: In the course of your speech you also mentioned agriculture and all of them are saying it is clearly an area where there is so much to be done. Why doesn't someone like you, why doesn't someone like Reliance get into that area in a really significant way and make a difference?  A: What I said is things that I genuinely believe. This is a time where things are coming together. There are combinatorial technologies without really covering the land mass with data technologies, without the sensors at the right price, without an overall vision - things have to come together and I think that things are coming together. India has a great opportunity and surely, as Reliance, this is a difficult problem to tackle. But we are ready to take on difficult problems and it is very much on our roadmap, we are building all the resources, we think through, we just do not jump into anything, we think through it carefully. But agriculture, education and healthcare, all three are on our roadmaps which are to my mind, the most difficult problems for any economy and they impact the majority of our people.  Q: You are thinking in terms of them?  A: Absolutely.  Q: Both in education and healthcare, you have these little foundational experiments that you have done. All three are probably areas that can benefit from the kind of scale that you usually bring to businesses.  A: Absolutely. Also, what we will be able to do in the next five years in terms of just raw usage of technology. This is the most difficult problem to solve. If we can solve it in India, we can pretty much use that anywhere else in the world. And that is why I say, India has the opportunity to lead the world. We have the opportunity first to solve it in India and then take it to the rest of the world.  Q: From its inception, Reliance has always had this reputation and image of being an extremely competitive company. You look at most of the businesses that you have gotten into, especially Jio for instance, you were not an early entrant, you were a relatively late entrant. There were incumbents in place and not just ordinary incumbents, but they were huge incumbents. You really seem to be relishing the challenge of this competition and everything else. So is this something you thrive on? Is it something that motivates you or do you just look at it from the consumer point of view?  A: Our DNA is that we are very focused and we always believe in the principle of saying that if you focus on the goal, you will overcome all obstacles. If you focus on the obstacle, you will never reach your goal. We are all believers of first principles and from our point of view, while the external world can see it, we work very hard and we focus on the goals that we want to achieve and we focus on first, principles.  We at Reliance, want to be the best in the world. It was even in the 1970s and 1980s when my father said that why should the Koreans and the Taiwanese lead the polyester industry? Why can't we in India? And today, we are known, we are the biggest in both, not only in size, but in quality. We had exactly the same conversation with Sunil and Rajan and ourselves in terms of saying that in the data driven digital services business, why can't India be the best? And that is what drives us. So, I am sorry if it appears very competitive from outside, but we just want to be the best in terms of what we do.  Q: Your children are now in the business and you worked very closely with your father when you first got into the business. What was the one thing which has really helped you that you learned from your father and what is the one thing which is really helping you now that you have learned from your children?  A: One thing that I could never, I would never dare tell my father is that dad, you do not get it. With this generation, that is the big difference.  Q: Do you get a lot of that?  A: I get quite a bit of that. I saw this speech and the first thing Isha told me is dad, very boring. I think, as far as my father is concerned, he has been really the biggest influence. He treated me like a friend and I hope that I can treat my children as a friend.  Q: What are you reading now? Do you get time to read?  A: I make it a point to read quite a bit. So I read a lot of technical stuff. So I am reading gene editing, CRISPR. Blockchain on the technical side. I read non-fiction. So I read five or six things at one time. In non-fiction I am reading, there is a great book that has come on Leonardo da Vinci by Walter Isaacson. He is my favourite author, so I read everything. Then I just finished Dan Brown's Origin.  Q: So you read fiction also.  A: So, I read fiction, non-fiction and technical, all at the same time.  Q: How would you define success?  A: For me, it is really fulfilment which is important which is the lasting satisfaction that you have, that you really tried your best and you have given it everything that you have. Sometimes, in spite of that, you might not achieve your outcome and you have to reconcile with that and that is what my philosophy in life is.

Moving from shadows in the audience to under the spotlight, Mukesh Ambani played it ever so smoothly. He called upon the &ldquo;big boys&rdquo; of the telecom sector to look beyond profits and losses, and instead think about the difference they were making to the consumer, and thereby to the country.  The Reliance Industries Chairman and Managing Director had just delivered a speech that talked about India&rsquo;s rise in the world order and the role it could play to lead the fourth industrial revolution. Post his speech, Ambani answered a few questions posed by Hindustan Times Editor-in-Chief Sukumar Ranganathan.  &ldquo;To me what is most important is 'Do we really move the country forward' and 'Does the consumer gain?' and I think that the question as a journalist that you should be thinking about is that 'even if there are profits and losses, who gains and who loses, and as long as the consumer gains, and the country moves forward, it's worth taking those losses, right? Some of us are big boys, we can afford that,&rdquo; Ambani said in reply to a question that referred to a recent statement by Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal.  That message would surely travel fast; Sunil Mittal's brothers, Rakesh and Rajan, were a part of the audience.  Mittal had recently said in an interview that Reliance Jio Infocomm&rsquo;s entry into the sector had led to its rivals writing off USD 50 billion in investments. Ambani may have a point. With the entry of Jio in September last year, data tariffs have fallen to a fraction of their levels a year ago while India&rsquo;s ranking in terms of data consumption has jumped to number one from 150. Some of Reliance Jio&rsquo;s rivals have been around in the industry for over 20 years.  Delivering his speech that lasted 25 minutes, Ambani said RIL was willing to go beyond the Rs 60,000 crore it had put in its last investment cycle for the next round of growth. He listed agriculture, education and healthcare as three areas on the group&rsquo;s roadmap where it saw tremendous opportunities.  &ldquo;Five years ago, when most Indian businesses were investing outside India, we decided to invest about USD 60 billion in India. We have nearly completed this investment cycle and we are now ready to commit even more in our next investment cycle. We are doing this out of our undiminished conviction that India is the next biggest investment opportunity in the world,&rdquo; Ambani said.  He said the time had come for a combination of technologies to play a role in agriculture, education and healthcare and solve societal problems without bothering to turn to governments and regulators for profits and losses.  &ldquo;This (agriculture) is a difficult problem to tackle but we are ready to take on difficult problems. It&rsquo;s very much on our roadmap, building of the resources, thinking through. We don&rsquo;t just jump into anything, we think through it carefully. Agriculture, education and healthcare, all three are on our roadmap which, to my mind, are the most difficult,&rdquo; he said.  He called upon foreign investors to &ldquo;invest in India, earn in India, grow in India, partner and prosper together with India&rdquo;. Ambani said by the middle of this century, India&rsquo;s rise would be higher than China&rsquo;s and more attractive and give the world a &ldquo;superior development model&rdquo;.  He said, &ldquo;We are in the age of super-intelligence. What manufacturing was for China, super-intelligence will be for India.&rdquo;  He said India&rsquo;s USD 2.5 trillion&nbsp;economy would most certainly hit the USD 5 trillion mark well before 2024 and then double by 2030.  He said the next three decades will be most defining for India and the country was positioned to lead the next revolution. He said by 2050, the country would have 300 million more people to feed. &ldquo;There is a pressing need and golden opportunity to create a digital green revolution. Data is not only the new oil, data is also the new soil,&rdquo; he said.  He said the fourth industrial revolution would be led by connectivity, computing, data and artificial intelligence. He said the new age would have three defining characteristics &ndash; the first being the exponential changes that technology would bring as against linear changes that happened earlier.  The second defining characteristic, he said, would see scarcity giving way to abundance &ndash; abundance of abundance of energy, health, agricultural output, manufacturing capacity, abundant knowledge and renewable materials.  The THIRD defining characteristic would be a migration from a goods and services economy to one powered by intelligent services.  &ldquo;There is no doubt that in the coming years, machine intelligence will augment and multiply biological intelligence manifold,&rdquo; Ambani said.

","Moneycontrol News  India has the potential to become a USD 10 trillion economy by 2030 and close the gap with China, said Mukesh Ambani, Chairman, Reliance Industries.  Ambani was speaking at the 15th HT Leadership Summit partnered by CNN-News18.  The entire world is seeing a resurgent India, he said, adding that the next three decades will be defining years for the country.  The world so far has seen three important industrial revolutions from the late 17th century up until now even as it is now in the grip of the fourth -- one which is defined by data connectivity, AI and computing. India, which was on the fringes in the first two industrial revolutions, can reap the dividends of this ongoing transformation, said Ambani.  Outlining the three characteristics that will enable India to improve its position in the world order, Ambani said that there has been a migration from the linear to exponential. &ldquo;Mobile telephony, virtual assistance and self-driven cars were science fiction a few years ago. Early adopters of these will have the first mover advantage to leapfrog the competition and create societal value.&rdquo;  The world is moving from scarcity to abundance as well, he said, adding that with the power of data connectivity and intelligence, the price performance of everything changes drastically.  This abundance will be for all, not for a privileged few, he said, adding that mankind was on the doorstep of ubiquitous availability. Bringing up the rear was intelligent services, which Ambani believed, will be the next frontier of market leadership across countries.  We can become the provider of intelligent services to the world, he said. Being a young nation, India can adapt to technology easily, and its lack of legacy means it can skip multiple generations of technology and embrace the next generation. He also mentioned that India had the political vision and determination to make India a tech leader.  India is positioned to become a leader in this new age, he said. As early signs of the promise India shows, he mentioned the rollout of Aadhaar and ISRO&rsquo;s feat of launching 104 satellites at a low cost.  In terms of mobile broadband penetration, India was ranked 150 two years ago, but after Jio launching teelcom services, India is number one, he said.

Financial sector clearly put on a stellar performance with RBL Bank and The Federal Bank posting a strong show. But being the best performing banks, it didn&rsquo;t come as a surprise.    The capital market focused entities like JM Financial and Motilal Oswal also posted a strong show.    The company that deserves a mention albeit its strong price performance is GIC Housing Finance. The company will be a big beneficiary of the government&rsquo;s affordable housing push. The average ticket-size of its loan is around Rs 16 lakhs and 50 percent of the loan exposure is below Rs 15 lakhs. Hence, the interest subsidy from the government will have a positive rub-off on volumes. However, the valuation at 3.2X FY17 book warrants cooling.  DCM Shriram and Coromandel International &ndash; both rural-focused entities -- deserve a closer look with a forecast of good rains this year. The quarter gone by saw commendable performance from these entities. UPL (United Phosphorous) too impressed with its numbers.    The other noteworthy numbers from the midcap universe included Supreme Petrochem, Supreme Industries, Tata Sponge Iron, Hatsun Agro, Hyderabad Industries, Deep Industries, Rushil D&eacute;cor and Menon Bearings.  Rajan Raheja Group promoted Supreme Petrochem is&nbsp;the largest&nbsp;producer and exporter of&nbsp;polystyrene polymer&nbsp;in India. Supreme Industries is India's largest plastic processor based in Mumbai. However, valuation comfort is warranted for fresh accumulation in these stocks.  Tata Sponge Iron benefitted from the revival in manufacturing activities in the domestic market that resulted in a rebound in sponge iron prices. Steel scrap, a substitute of sponge iron, is trading at a significant premium that should drive demand. Finally, the company is debt-free with a cash per share of Rs 369.  The CK Birla Group promoted HIL (Hyderabad Industries) produces roofing solutions, panels, walling blocks, plywood substitutes, high-quality pipes and fittings, and industrial insulation. Despite the 40 percent run-up in the stock, the valuation looks reasonable.  Menon Bearings produces bi-metal engine bearings, bushes and thrust washers for light and heavy automobile engines, two-wheeler engines and compressors for refrigerators and air conditioners. It also offers aluminium die casting component under &ldquo;ALKOP&rdquo; brand. The company derives 78 percent of revenue from bearing and bushes and 22 percent from ALKOP. The share of exports stands at 28 percent. &nbsp;An interesting idea that warrants some patience after the 55 percent run-up in the past year.    Rushil D&eacute;cor, which is into the manufacturing of laminated sheets and MDF and Hatsun Agro is the largest private sector dairy company in India. Both these companies have been a favourite of savvy investors for a while and despite their strong show, valuation doesn&rsquo;t lend comfort.  We would also like to highlight some decent numbers from some completely unknown names.    Tracking the unknown names for discovering future winners is key to investing success. Hence, all the winners spotted here deserve attention.

Analysts, too, have given the numbers their thumbs-up as well.  The petrochemical major's quarterly earnings beat analysts' expectations on Monday as profit on a standalone basis grew by 1.6 percent sequentially to Rs 8,151 crore for January-March quarter. Net income on consolidated basis rose 7 percent to Rs 8,053 crore QoQ.  Standalone revenue from operations during the quarter increased 12 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 74,598 crore while consolidated revenue soared 10.33 percent to Rs 92,889 crore, the company said in its filing.  Reliance reported gross refining margin for the quarter at USD 11.50 a barrel, which was far ahead of analysts' estimates of USD 11 a barrel and outperformed Singapore complex margins by USD 5.2 a barrel. It had posted GRM at 10.8 a barrel in December quarter.  The company&rsquo;s stock was in the news recently when it surpassed Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in terms of market capitalisation and also became the most valued company in the country. Analysts have largely given positive calls on the stock, driven by a reduction of capex cycle in sight and better metrics in the results.  Citi maintained its buy call on the stock with an increase in its bull case target to Rs 1,923 due to higher Jio valuation and lower peak net debt. It believes that the company&rsquo;s outperformance could sustain as the earnings are at an inflection point. Among key risks to the stock are weakening in refining fundamentals and global petrochemical spreads, the research firm added.  Analysts at the firm termed the company&rsquo;s March quarter performance as strong, with the standalone EBITDA being 3 percent ahead of estimates. Meanwhile, the profit after tax (PAT) was largely in line, it said. Gross refining margins of USD 11.5 per barrel were above its estimates, it said.  On the company&rsquo;s capex plans, it sees standalone capex being lesser than USD 2.5 billion in FY18. Jio&rsquo;s capex in the first quarter of the fiscal will be similar to March quarter before declining sharply, it said.  Nomura maintained its buy call on the stock as well, but with an unchanged target price of Rs 1,540. The brokerage house observed that the net profit was 1-2 percent ahead of its estimates, driven by lower tax rate. It too feels that the recent outperformance of the company could sustain.  However, the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and profit before tax (PBT) were below its estimates on the back of higher depreciation and lower other income. These numbers too were partly offset by lower finance costs, it added.  Going forward, it sees earnings growing ahead once Jio, petchem and refining expansion projects start to deliver. It expects consolidated EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 19 percent/15 percent, respectively over FY16-20.  Meanwhile, it observed that high capex on Jio continued during the quarter and expects similar capex in Q1 of this fiscal. The near-term focus will be on addition in customers of Jio. Having said that, it feels that the large capex cycle is coming to an end.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch has downgraded the stock to neutral, but increased the target price to Rs 1,450 from Rs 1,375. The global brokerage firm observed that the firm&rsquo;s March quarter net profit was 9 percent above estimates, while refining beat was led by GRM.  Analysts at the firm now have the focus on Jio&rsquo;s success and the capex cycle. They believe that a further rerating on the stock is contingent on a successful Jio P&amp;amp;amp;L as well as falling capex. It further added that while capex could decline, there is limited visibility on a successful Jio P&amp;amp;amp;L.  The stock could find support from growth in Jio&rsquo;s monthly subscribers, while weak margin, project startup hiccups and high capex were the key risks, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.  Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, has an overweight rating on the stock as it saw upside risks from improving energy margins as well as project executions. A steady project pipeline commissioning from FY18 should reduce the risk of further capex, it added.  JPMorgan is neutral on the stock with an increased target price of Rs 1,310 from Rs 1,240. While the lower capex in its core business was positive, Jio was the key unknown element, it said. Further extension of discounts by Jio would be negative, it added.  Rolling forward its valuation to FY19, Deutsche Bank raised its target by 10 percent to Rs 1,600. Lower downstream margins, policy vagaries were the key downside risks for stock, it said.  The stock has moved around 12 percent in the past one month, while its three-day gain stood at 5 percent. At 11:04 hrs, Reliance Industries was quoting at Rs 1,437.90, up Rs 21.50, or 1.52 percent on the BSE. It touched a 52-week high of Rs 1,465.00.

RI,2017-04-25T11:18:01+05:30,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Sidhartha Shukla'}",Expert take: Decoding Reliance Industries' fourth-quarter results beat,"Reliance Industries' results for the quarter ended March 31, which were announced post market hours on Monday, were largely ahead of most analysts&rsquo; expectations.","Reliance Industries reported its fourth quarter earnings result today where the company's&nbsp;profit on standalone basis grew by 1.6 percent sequentially to Rs 8,151 crore for January-March quarter. Net income on consolidated basis rose 7 percent to Rs 8,053 crore QoQ.  Reacting to the results, market experts SP Tulsian, &nbsp;Deven Choksey, Sudip Bandopadhyay, Prakash Diwan and Sudeep Anand listed their views on the results.  Below is the interview transcript.  Anuj: The other number which is important is, and this could lead to a bit of an uptick on the stock tomorrow, is the Jio subscription number. 72 million was the last reported number, street was pencilling in 90-100 million. That number is now 108.9 million subscribers at the end March. 108.9 million subscribers, that is the number that we have. Thoughts on that number?   Tulsian: These are the excellent numbers. I do not think anyone has even really talked of the 11 crore kind of subscribers because everyone, if you have seen the optimists migration which people have been expecting was at about 70 percent. And at that time, it was expected that probably 10 crore has come as a free subscribers. So, even if we get to see 7-7.5 crore, it will be seen quite good. But if they have touched 10.89 crore subscribers and I think you can take that ballpark as 11 crore, that is phenomenal. Nobody must have thought of these kind of numbers.  Anuj: This petchem performance, they are talking about some softening in prices, PVC and a couple of others. But do you think the market will absorb that?   Tulsian: That has to do because if you really see this all petchem prices are always import parity prices and as I said, because of the strengthening rupee, you have seen that. But I see honestly, the very robust demand and actually that is seen getting reflected also. I have not seen the press release because we have been estimating petchem volume to be at 6.45 million metric tonne for this quarter and actually even if there is soft margin because of this strengthening rupee, probably that will get offset by the increased capacity because we have seen huge capacity additions having taken place in petchem. You have not seen any capacity addition happening for the company in any of the segments, whether it is the smaller one, whether it is upstream or in the refinery, but in petchem they have been going in a very aggressive way.  So, I will not be because we have seen the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margins at 13 percent which otherwise was expected to be at 14.5-15 percent. So, even if there is a drop of about 150 basis point on the expectations on the EBIT margin, I do not think that market should really have complaint as long as it gets compensated with the higher volume.  Anuj: The petchem that you were looking at is 6.2 million metric tonnes.   Tulsian: I think this is actually the cause of disappointment because I have estimated petchem EBIT margin at Rs 3,690 crore on 6.45 million metric tonnes. So, I will not be disappointed to see the EBIT of Rs 3,441 on the lower volume of 6.2 which you have said just now because actually there has been robust demand of this petchem, polymer and polyester, both, in this quarter and probably, but on their overseas, they are very active in the overseas market also on the polymer and polyester. And when you talk to the overseas buyer maybe like in Nigeria and all that, they have been saying that they are getting the cheaper petchem, polymer in Nigeria than what the company sells. So, maybe a mix of overseas and domestic market probably has seen the lower offtake, but the margin is seen maintained on the absolute number.  Anuj: Stock is up 30 percent this month or this year rather. How much more from here on, on these numbers?   Choksey: On one side we have got the refining business expanding by one third capacity. This is happening in the second quarter of this financial year, we are with the commentary. On the other side, the feed stock changing is also happening in this particular quarter, maybe in the second quarter maybe we will be seeing the announcement coming in as to margin that they have produced. So again, on one side, volume improvement, second side, profitability improvement from crore business of refining.  Already the petrochemical polymer productions has started giving capacity of around 28,000 metric tonnes. So, that again is suggesting that volume wise, they would be growing far bigger in this particular space. So, core business itself is contributing significantly which is translating to somewhere around Rs 10 price-earnings ratio (P/E) from core business alone.  Look at the Jio business and interpret this business a little bit more. 11 crore subscribers with the current tariff, it translates to somewhere around Rs 40,000-41,000 crore worth of revenue. And somewhere around before interest, depreciation or amortisation, the profit could be somewhere around Rs 17,000-18,000 crore.  Now if this number translates to 20 crore subscribers which is most from the data business that this company is cultivating, my reading says that Jio alone would give you a valuation of around Rs 600 per share. Along with the retail business, it could easily add up to around Rs 1,00,000 crore of market cap if it is a separate business listed. So, put together, somewhere around Rs 1,800 kind of a price range for Reliance Industries is distinctly seen whether it happens now or six months down the line, one will have to field. But I think it should happen as far as the valuation goes.  Anuj: Your thoughts on what kind of reaction the market gives tomorrow?   Choksey: I have been maintaining that this is three years of bull phase which has started for Reliance and probably having seen all the Capex programmes completed in refining business, in petrochemical polymer businesses, also largely the Capex programme completing in the Jio business and retail business. All of these verticals are expected to produce some sizeable amount of revenue and profits. As I see it, the core business is still valued at around 10 price multiple which according to me holds a clear chance of rerating because of the one third improvement in the profit performance itself which is seen on the cards.  And other two business which have not started reflecting into the price could also reflect big time. Now, if the long only investors come into the market, they may probably take the position and in the short-term also the stock price could perform. But if you are holding two years and 2.5 years view from now, I see a possibility of more than double the stock price from current levels.  Anuj: It looks like it is a beat on most parameters. Clearly GRM and this Reliance Jio numbers standing out which really have been the big triggers for the company. Do you think the stock has legs to go even after the 30 percent rally?   Bandopadhyay: I think so. The result which they have come up with on both on GRM as well as looks like on the petchem side, core businesses which produce about two third and one third of their respective profits, they have done very well. Nobody expected USD 11 plus per barrel of GRM, so USD 11.5 per barrel is definitely great. Also remember, the Jio numbers which they have come up with is actually beyond expectations. So, if they can convert at least 50 percent of the numbers into a paying customers from the next quarter onwards, that itself will take Reliance to a different level. There is a little bit of disappointment on both the exploration piece and the retail. But having said that, from here on, at least 10 percent upside I do see in Reliance within the next six months.  Anuj: We have got all the numbers, USD 11.5 per barrel on GRM, we have 109 million subscribers for Reliance Jio. Your thoughts on how the stock moves from here?   Anand: Definitely the refinery side, it has surprised us positively. We were expecting slightly lower around USD 10.4 per barrel of GRM but they have delivered very strong GRM. On the petrochemical side, slightly disappointment. We had anticipated around Rs 36 billion of profit, but still the overall operating profit is pretty strong. And secondly Jio subscriber base of over 100 million is definitely one of the major positives for the company also.  Anuj: Your thoughts on what could be the fair value of the stock because Rs 1200-1250 is assumed as the fair value for the traditional business. So, based on these numbers where do you see the stock moving?   Diwan: It is on a trailing basis that Rs 1250-1260 sounds fairly good as a price. Secondly, we need to see it in the perspective that the stock is kind of playing catch up for the last 7-8 years that it hasn&rsquo;t kind of delivered on a CAGR basis. So, there is no arithmetic that says that it has to be in a linear progression. It could be a geometric progression in terms of price discovery. The current business, the traditional business, core business could also get valued at about Rs 1450-1500 which is what it is currently close to, you are getting the Jio business for free in the current price. Now it depends on whether you want to give the Jio business 2 years or 1 year and pencil that in, back of the envelope calculation is anywhere between Rs 500-650. Remember Mukesh Ambani&rsquo;s words that, when he said we will have profitability margins in the mid-teens from the Jio business in some time.  If that happens we are talking about a dramatic change in the company&rsquo;s revenue stream, which brings down a lot of other costs as well which have been burdening the company on the interest side. So, my sense is Rs 2000 is what I would look at as a next threshold. Anything above Rs 2000 is where you would need to revaluate in terms of whether you want to book profits or whatever but from Rs 1400 to Rs 2000, I don&rsquo;t see the trajectory to be interrupted by anything very major.  Anuj: Your thoughts on tomorrow&rsquo;s reaction?   Diwan: My earlier target was more long term. The stock has had this feeling of saying it is overbought, it has over done, the upside has been too rapid but these numbers will give that validation for whoever has bought into it even at let us say about Rs 1300-1400 band. So, nobody is going to book profits. You will probably see a new wave of buying that will emerge post the expiry. I think the expiry is going to be a big milestone of sorts for which people would want to wait out because of the huge futures positions. However post that in the next few days I would see a lot of genuine buying which would come into the stock which will probably in the next week or so take it to that Rs 1500 plus mark as well.  Anuj: Tomorrow morning, what kind of verdict does the street give to Reliance numbers?   Tulsian: Looking to the momentum which we are seeing in the stock, people will definitely be taking these two or three things. In fact, you have said that petchem is a bit disappointment, but I do not agree, in fact I have satisfaction from all three core operations that is petchem refining and as well as Reliance Jio subscribers. So, obviously I am keeping a positive view. Earlier I have been giving a price target of Rs 1,350-1,400, but probably market should receive well these results and maybe an upside of about Rs 50 can be expected largely because of the technical factor till expiry maybe in the next three days because people are short in the counter as well so some kind of short covering and informed buying and people, those who have been holding the long positions will see that expiry happens on a positive note.

Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview.  Anuj: We were discussing this yesterday when the numbers came but you would have looked at all the numbers now, what is the call on Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) at current levels?  A: The first call was the things are good, it could only improve and I think the numbers have just validated that. People are talking about this disappointment in the petchem, EBITDA and things like that but we need to understand that the company is in constant capacity enhancement either it is augmenting the technology or it is expanding sheer capacity. Today the kind of USD 5 arbitrage between Singapore and its gross refining margins (GRMs) means that this is a quasi-mode that is developing for the company. So even if there is a little bit of short in terms of crude prices and all at least it manages to keep itself in a profitable territory. So petchem, 50-60 percent of the benefit of the capex will come in the next 12 months and the rest is for FY19.  So if you were to start looking at it from a two-year perspective, the catch up that Reliance has started with 30-35 percent upside we have seen in the last couple of months is probably just the beginning of a very strong bull run. It will start getting the Jio numbers. 1,80,000 crore is not a mean number to spend on and recover but why is that profitability starts improving incrementally every day, every month, I think we are giving it a little bit of a sceptical rating and P/E multiple at this current level.  My rough calculation tells me that the price on a core business itself should be above Rs 1,550, the Jio business right now is free now. Some people say it is a loss-making thing, so that is why we are not discounting it positively but if you were to take that on the basis of a rough discounted cash flow (DCF), I think this stock could be Rs 2,000 probably in the next 12-15 months itself.  Latha: Is there more to buy in HDFC Bank and do you see collateral advantage in any other stocks?  A: This is like when you start running out of good opportunities, whatever comes your way and you want to put the bucket out as Warren Buffet keeps on saying but to be honest, there is so much available in that NBFC and banking space and I think the PSU banks are still &ndash; the bigger ones, let us not get into this whole long list of midcaps, smallcap banks in the PSU side - definitely offer much more upside in terms of the re-rating that is underway.  HDFC Bank is a comeback that foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have made and that is one of the reasons why you have seen that overzealous buying that has happened. On the fundamentals, a lot of other banks have started delivering incrementally much better value. So I would not read too much into the mood that is changed towards HDFC Bank suddenly.  I would look at some of the other banks and not to say that some of the other banks haven&rsquo;t done well as well. They have also been amply rewarded whether it is IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank, RBL. Look at small, big, everything is getting amply rewarded. So in that liberal mood that we are in, there could be some better opportunities as well.  Sonia: Lately we are seeing a lot of companies that have an exposure to Maruti Suzuki that are doing very well, the auto ancillaries, whether it is Jay Bharat Maruti, Lumax Industries, Subros etc, the rally has been thick and fast but any stocks where there is still value?  A: Let us look at some of the smaller ones and they might not necessarily be Maruti oriented in terms of their growth so we talked about the Shivam Autotech casually once.  However, what is changing there and I think the quarterly numbers will probably capture that is that they have set up a pilot with Bosch &ndash; one is they have got the Rohtak unit already commissioned, Bosch unit if that takes off, they could probably be one of the very few global auto ancillary plays where Bosch has given out that technology and wants to depend on it.  Now given the globalisation that is happening, Indian automobile ancillary units supplying to some of the OEMs across the world will benefit much more because this is one space where China does not compete much, the Latin American markets have slowed down quite a bit, Europe is not competing as much, I would still look at some of the quasi global plays in this and I keep on talking about the likes of the Endurance Tech and Motherson Sumi. So you stick to those, not necessarily just the domestic ones.  This space you cannot write-off so easily as yet just because the valuations have been so stellar, a lot of people have had doubts but I would still be a bit picky but keep myself exposed to the space quite a bit.

For the consolidated numbers for the fourth quarter of FY17 &ndash; the 45 percent growth in revenue was driven by 50 percent and 26 percent growth in refining and petrochemicals respectively; whereas organised retail also posted a strong show, growing by 83 percent. Despite a tad subdued margin performance, substantial savings in interest expenses drove the 12 percent growth in profit.    Segmental Highlights  For the key segment of refining - the Gross Refining Margin (GRM) stood at USD 11.5 per barrel against USD 10.8 per barrel in the previous quarter. RIL&rsquo;s GRM outperformed Singapore complex margins by USD 5.1 per barrel. The lower sequential margin was on account of lower gasoline and naphtha cracks.  For the petrochemicals segment, the strong topline growth was aided by an increase in prices across all products, which was partially offset by lower volumes. The stable margin performance was supported by product prices.  Oil and gas continued with a subdued performance. The decline in revenue was led by lower upstream production and lower domestic gas price realisation. Volumes were lower on account of a slowdown in development activity and natural decline. Consequently, the segment margin was negative.  Retail posted a stellar show &ndash; quarterly revenue crossing the 10,000 mark. The increase in turnover was led by growth across all consumption baskets. The margin performance was also stable. Reliance Retail added 63 stores across various store concepts. At the end of the year, it operated 3,616 stores across 702 cities with an area of over 13.5 million square feet.    The Growth Drivers  The update on Jio was a key takeaway of the earnings. Jio had 108.9 million subscribers on the network. While it isn&rsquo;t revenue accretive at the moment, the key factor to watch out for in Jio is the capacity that&rsquo;s in place. Jio has the world&rsquo;s largest greenfield 4G LTE wireless broadband network, with over 100,000 mobile towers, and will add another 100,000 towers to the network in the coming months.  The business hasn&rsquo;t yet started meaningful revenue contribution as it launched with a nominal, one-time enrolment fee of Rs 99. It has been followed up with Jio Dhan Dhana Dhan - at Rs 309 for three months and an unlimited plan at Rs 509 for high data users. However, any future tariff plan will only add to revenue and help achieve break-even of this business.  Reliance Industries had embarked upon USD 20 billion core capex which is seeing fruition. One of the major core projects, based on the USD 1.5bn ethane imports from the US - has been commissioned. The highly competitive ethane imports will replace the existing expensive propane feedstock to RIL&rsquo;s crackers, would result in meaningful savings.  The company also updated that it has&nbsp;commenced commercial production from its Coal Bed Methane (CBM). The production from RIL&rsquo;s Sohagpur CBM fields will gradually ramp-up in the next 15-18 months making RIL among the largest unconventional natural gas producers in India.  RIL also mentioned installation of Para-Xylene, Cracker and downstream projects (MEG, Linear Low density and Low density Polyethylene) as well as Gasification.  The traction in telecom revenue and the commissioning of the core projects will be the key drivers of incremental performance going forward. These fundamental drivers alongside a decent valuation of 12.8X FY18 price to earnings lends substantial margin of safety for investors.

Gross refining margins recorded an eight-year-high of $ 11.0/bbl whereas petrochemicals EBIT margin were at a five-year high level of 14 percent.  Operating profit before other income and depreciation increased by 10.8 percent on a Y-o-Y basis to Rs 46,194 crore ($ 7.1 billion) from Rs 41,704 crore in the previous year.  &amp;quot;Refining and petrochemicals businesses achieved record levels of profitability, underpinned by our ability to access feedstock competitively from global markets, maintain high operating rates and place products in growth markets,&amp;quot; Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries Limited said.  &amp;quot;With ongoing projects our portfolio will become significantly more robust and integrated, securing long-term profitable growth,&amp;quot; he said.

Dividend  The Board of Directors has recommended a dividend of Rs 11 per fully paid up Equity share of Rs 10/- each for the financial year 2016-17, aggregating Rs 3,916 crore ($ 604 million), including dividend distribution tax.  Petrochemical Business  Q4 FY17 revenue from the Petrochemicals segment increased by 26.4 percent on a Y-o-Y basis to Rs 26,478 crore (USD 4.1 billion), primarily due to increase in prices across all products, this was partially offset by lower volumes. Petrochemicals segment EBIT increased by 25.8 percent to Rs3,441 crore (USD 531 million), supported by favorable product deltas, RIL said in a statement.  Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas Business  For the quarter ended March 31, revenues for the Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas segment decreased by 19.9 percent on a Y-o-Y basis to Rs 1,309 crore. Continuing weak price environment in the domestic market and declining production trend impacted segment revenues.

Organised Retail  Q4 FY17 revenues grew by 83 percent on a Y-o-Y basis to Rs 10,332 crore, a milestone level for quarterly revenues.

Condensate production in Q4 FY17 was at 0.06 MMBBL.  Fall in oil and gas production was mainly on account of natural decline in the fields coupled with water and sand ingress. The 2nd Side track well in MA field was completed and was put into production. Currently, eight&nbsp;wells in D1D3 and 4 wells in MA are producing. Efforts are on to keep the wells flowing until production from new projects come on stream.

The Indian subsidiary is the second-largest player in the bearings market with 15 percent market share. It is well-diversified across segments and is the market leader in the passenger vehicle segment. The industry is at an inflection point, and for risk-averse investors a stock like Fag offers mid teen earnings growth story.  International Travel House, an associate company of ITC Limited and which offers a full bouquet of travel services, also reported a performance worth taking note of. Despite a modest topline growth, significant improvement in operating margin aided a significant surge in profit.  The run-up in the past one year has been modest and the valuation looks reasonable seen in the context of the financial performance of The Tinplate Company of India (TCIL), a subsidiary of Tata Steel. The company&nbsp;is a producer of tin coated and tin free sheets. It&nbsp;manufactures various grades of electrolytic tinplates, tin-free steel sheets and full hard cold rolled sheets (FHCR) used for metal packaging.

RI,2017-01-05T17:52:05+05:30,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'webtech_news18'}",Global cos offer ONGC deepsea drilling rigs for KG gas find,As many as 10 international offshore drilling contractors including Transocean Inc have offered best-in-class deepsea drilling rigs to Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) for its KG-D5 gas field developments.,"As many as 10 international offshore drilling contractors including Transocean Inc have offered best-in-class deepsea drilling rigs to Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) for its KG-D5 gas field developments. ONGC had floated a tender to charter hire two deepwater drilling rigs and one anchor moored rig for bringing gas in Bay of Bengal block KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5, which sits next to Reliance Industries' flagging KG-D6 fields, to production. &amp;quot;We have received tremendous response to the tender. International drilling contractors have bid very aggressively,&amp;quot; an official said. ONGC is among the very few explorers around the world who are actually going ahead with the development campaign despite low oil prices. &amp;quot;And naturally, contractors have no new job outside and so they are queueing up here,&amp;quot; he said. Transocean Offshore International Ventures Ltd offered Deepwater Millenium, Discoverer India and Discoverer Luanda deepwater rigs while Ensco Maritime Ltd offered two of its rigs, Ensco 8500 and Ensco 8501. Other bidders include Seadrill Orion Ltd, Drillship Kythnos Owners Inc, Dupont Maritime LLC, Dynamic Drilling &amp;amp;amp; Services, Ensco Maritime Ltd, Queiroz Galvano Leo Gas, Seadrill Orion, Universial Energy Resources Ind, Vantage International management Co and Japan Drilling Co. ONGC is investing USD 5.07 billion for developing Cluster-II discoveries in KG-D5 block to flow natural gas from from June 2019 and oil by March 2020. The 7,294.6-sq-km deepsea KG-D5 block has been broadly categorised into Northern Discovery Area (NDA&amp;amp;nbsp;3,800.6 sq km) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA&amp;amp;nbsp;3,494 sq km). The NDA has 11 oil and gas discoveries while SDA has the nation's only ultra-deepsea gas find of UD-1. These finds have been clubbed in three groups&amp;amp;nbsp; Cluster-1, Cluster-II and Cluster-III. Gas discovery in Cluster-I is to be tied up with finds in neighbouring G-4 block for production but this is not being taken up currently because of a dispute with RIL over migration of gas from ONGC blocks, the official said. From Cluster-II, a peak oil output of 77,305 barrels per day is envisaged within two years of start of production. Gas output is slated to peak to 16.56 million standard cubic meters per day by end-2021. Cluster-2A mainly comprises of oil finds of A2, P1, M3, M1 and G-2-2 in NDA, which can produce 77,305 bpd (3.86 million tonnes per annum) and 3.81 mmscmd of gas. Cluster-2B, which is made up of four gas finds&amp;amp;nbsp;R1, U3, U1, and A1 in NDA&amp;amp;nbsp;envisages a peak output of 12.75 mmscmd of gas, the official said, adding that peak output is likely to last 7 years. Cluster-III is the UD-1 gas discovery in SDA in ultra- deepsea that poses technological challenges.
