It is also planning to part-sell its stake in SBI Cards.  ,"SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar on December 17 said it will take up to three years more to list its general insurance arm. The bank will list its asset management company before SBI General Insurance, Kumar said while speaking at the India Economic Conclave organised by Times Network here.  SBI had last year listed its life insurance arm and the proceeds came in handy to fight difficulties in asset quality. It is also planning to part-sell its stake in SBI Cards.  SBI General Insurance, which is a joint venture with Insurance Australia Group, has to &amp;quot;mature&amp;quot; and will await the valuation to touch Rs 50,000 crore, Kumar said.  &amp;quot;We are discussing but if you ask me sequentially then it will be AMC first then SBI General because. We believe that still it is about 2-3 years away before SBI General matures,&amp;quot; he said.  Speaking on the asset quality position, Kumar reiterated that non-performing assets had touched a peak last quarter and there will be an improvement from this quarter onwards.  On telecom exposure, Kumar said the bank had burnt its &amp;quot;fingers and body&amp;quot; in the past, but sounded more confident for the sector now.  He said the risk is a &amp;quot;lot less&amp;quot; now and also added that the bank is in a position to absorb setbacks, if any, in the future.  The bank is not getting much of demand for large projects given the state of the economy and the project loans are much smaller now, Kumar said.  Amid a sustained period of liquidity surplus, he said availability of money to fund the debt requirements of corporates is not the problem, but it is equity raising which is proving to be a difficulty.  Companies are facing difficulties for equity raising due to a slew of concerns, including the general economic scenario and the low investor confidence due to setbacks like losing money in the past.  Kumar said he does not see any &amp;quot;major changes&amp;quot; when it comes to consolidation of state-owned banks.  He, however, hinted that state ownership of lenders limits the discretion of the management in taking business decisions as compared to private sector rivals.  &amp;quot;When you are a private bank, you still have a choice in terms of selecting your client. In SBI, you don't have that choice at times, even if business is not generating profits,&amp;quot; he said.  The SBI chief also admitted that the lender has not delivered to equity investors, but sought the bank to be evaluated on the basis of &amp;quot;stakeholder value&amp;quot; that it is generating.  The equity valuations are suppressed because of a &amp;quot;small segment&amp;quot; not representing over 10 per cent of the balancesheet, which pulls down the performance, Kumar said.  Rather than looking at returns for equity holders by way of share price appreciation, there is a need to look at wider &amp;quot;stakeholder returns&amp;quot; which more number of people across the world are tracking, he said.  Kumar said SBI does not need any capital from the government and will depend on internal accruals and profits itself for its buffers, and also exhorted its peers to do the same.","Business,SBI",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/sbi-plan-to-list-general-insurance-arm-may-take-3-yrs-rajnish-kumar_13279421.html

","A consortium of Indian public sector banks led by State Bank of India (SBI) sought a bankruptcy order against embattled liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya during a High Court hearing in London on December 11 as part of efforts to recoup around 1.145 billion pounds in unpaid loans.  Judge Michael Briggs presided over the ongoing hearing in the insolvency division of the court on a bankruptcy petition filed by the banks last year, in relation to lending by Mallya's now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.  &amp;quot;Why should we take less than everything we are owed,&amp;quot; said Marcia Shekerdemian, the barrister for the Indian banks, in reference to settlement offers.  The court also heard that the banks do not accept the former Kingfisher Airlines boss' assertion that most of his assets are in India and to a lesser extent worldwide. A villa in France and assets spread across the British Virgin Islands, a trust registered in the Caribbean nation of St. Kitts &amp;amp;amp; Nevis and the Indian Empress superyacht in Malta were some of Mallya's worldwide assets referred to during the course of Wednesday's hearing.  &amp;quot;We cannot take Dr Mallya's assertions at face value,&rdquo; Shekerdemian said.  Mallya's legal team, led by barrister Philip Marshall, argued for the bankruptcy petition to be dismissed because their client was being unfairly pursued by the banks in India and the UK on opposing grounds.  &amp;quot;Payment has been inhibited by virtue of the intervention by the Enforcement Directorate of India&hellip; the banks are seeking a bankruptcy order against Dr Mallya for non-payment but have created a situation where he can't make a payment,&rdquo; Marshall told the court.  A previous UK High Court ruling had refused to overturn a worldwide order freezing Mallya's assets and upheld an Indian court's ruling that the consortium of 13 Indian banks were entitled to recover funds amounting to nearly 1.145 billion pounds. The banks then launched efforts to recover dues as part of the freezing order, with the bankruptcy petition aimed at seizing UK-based Mallya's assets to recover the dues.  Meanwhile, Mallya remains on bail pending the UK High Court appeal hearing in the extradition proceedings brought by India in relation to alleged fraud and money laundering charges amounting to Rs 9,000 crores.  He had been arrested on an extradition warrant back in April 2017 and has been fighting his extradition in the UK courts since then.

Judge Michael Briggs is presiding over a hearing in the insolvency division of the court in London this week in relation to a bankruptcy petition filed by the banks back in 2018 in their attempt to recoup unpaid debt accrued by the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.

Pvt Ltd.  They have secured follow-on High Court orders to recover some of the funds owed to them as a result of Kingfisher Airlines' unpaid loans.  In July, the banks had won a High Court battle to access documents they were after to establish the true ownership of assets they believed were linked with the embattled liquor tycoon.  &ldquo;Frankly, the answer needs to be known as to which assets are that of Mr Mallya, both for the purpose of the worldwide freezing order and enforcement of the judgment,&rdquo; Justice Robin Knowles had ruled.  Two superyachts, a game reserve in South Africa, numerous undeclared high-value and vintage cars, valuable paintings and a piano previously owned by famous British singer-songwriter Elton John were among some of the assets on their target list.  The true ownership of a plush home overlooking Regent's Park in the heart of London also remains in contention.  Mallya's legal team has argued that the petition for bankruptcy in the UK should be dismissed because the banks are pursuing the same debt through the Indian courts.

Now new timeline starts from December 6.","Intense competition has seen one of the biggest iron ore mine auctions in India getting delayed, with some bidders pointing out loopholes, and others defending their turf.  The Odisha government had earlier this year called for bids for 20 mines, leases of which will lapse in March next year. The auction saw bids from the likes of Tata Steel, Vedanta, JSW Steel, ArcelorMittal and JSPL. Overall, more than 50 companies had shown interest. One of the mines alone has a deposit of about 800 million tonnes.  But now the government has been forced to call for fresh auctions, after some players, including ArcelorMittal pointed out 'loopholes' in the process.&nbsp;A report said that the Adani Group has also complained about the same.  The loophole, said an executive from the industry, allowed JSW Steel to put in several bids through its subsidiaries.&nbsp; Subsequently, the state government has brought about amendments in its tendering process.  Now, &amp;quot;a bidder shall submit only one bid for a particular mineral block. In case, a bidder submits more than one bid...through its affiliates, all such bids...will be rejected,&amp;quot; says a notification from the government.  The state has now announced a new timeline for the auction, which will now take off from December 6. The bids have to be submitted by January 3, 2020. Technically qualified bidders will be announced by February 19, and the announcement of the preferred bidder will be made on February 21.  While JSW Steel declined to comment, sources said that the company had only done what was permitted under the law. &amp;quot;There was a loophole, which has now been removed,&amp;quot; said an official.  The slurry pipeline saga  For ArcelorMittal, the mines are important to bring down costs at Essar Steel, for which the world's largest steelmaker put in a bid of Rs 42,000 crore.  It has already got a boost, in the form of the Odisha Slurry Pipeline Infrastructure (OSPL). The pipeline supplies iron ore to Essar Steel's pellet plant in Odisha. The pellets are then taken to Hazira to be used in Essar Steel's plants.  ArcelorMittal has emerged as the highest bidder, with a bid of Rs 2,300 crore bid. Though Thriveni Earthmovers, a dominant player in Odisha's mining industry, has bid over Rs 3,000 crore, the offer comes with a few riders.  Thriveni's offer is conditional, has a low upfront cash payment, and plus the payment schedule is long-drawn.  &ldquo;For lenders, who have been focused on realising maximum recovery in these insolvency cases, the upfront payment element is paramount. It is conditional on the outcome of an existing legal dispute around the title of the asset,&amp;quot; said an executive from the industry.  The turn of events will be a relief for lenders too, as things had got complicated in 2018, when Numetal - which had also bid for Essar Steel - claimed to have bought OSPL from Srei&nbsp;Infrastructure Fund. But the sale was disputed by the company's lenders, led by SBI, who claimed that SREI is not the rightful owner of the pipeline company.","ArcelorMittal,Business,Companies","https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/a-""loophole""-prompts-odisha-to-delay-onethe-biggest-mine-auctionsrecent-times_13239121.html"

When asked if SBI will be considering chipping off its stake a little more, he replied: &ldquo;As of now, as of now we don't have any such plan because it is business which is very complementary to SBI's primary activity.

Thakur said the banks do not levy any such penalty on basic savings bank accounts (BSBD) including those opened under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.  Till March-end 2019, there were 57.3 crore BSBD accounts across the country, including 35.27 crore Jan Dhan accounts, as per RBI. There is no minimum balance penalty for these accounts, Thakur said.  BSBD accounts provide certain basic minimum facilities free of charge.  For accounts other than BSBD accounts, banks are permitted to fix service charges on various services rendered by them.

Many stocks, where bulls have shown massive buying interest, are now likely to go sideways. We have picked State Bank of India (SBI) from the pack, as we are now heading towards expiry week, the delta neutral and theta depreciating strategy needs to be adopted.  Traders can opt for 'Short Straddle' and short At The Money (ATM) call as well as Put option. Generally, at near the expiration, all In The Money (ITM) options trade almost at their intrinsic value. At that time, stop loss should be at break even points to cap the losses.  What option data suggests  Option data suggests the stock might trade in the sideways zone in the coming trading sessions as fresh writing has been witnessed in At The Money (ATM) options. Close to 1,44,000 short contracts have been added in Rs 330 Put options, while the same strike price call option has witnessed open interest addition of 6,78,000 contracts.  The stock is likely to trade in a tight range as cumulative open in Rs 320 PE has summed upto approximately 40 lakh contracts. On the call side the nearest hurdle is placed at Rs 340 where cumulative open interest holds around 80 lakh contracts on short side.  Technical structure  After a sharp rally, the stock has shown bearish divergence in the overbought zone. The counter is trading far above its short term moving averages and the current structure suggests that the bulls and bears might try to maintain their equilibrium.  The weekly RSI is trading near important resistance zone and suggests that the rally might abated at current levels and the stock could go sideways. The immediate support level for the stock is placed at Rs 320, and on higher side Rs 338, is likely to act as an important resistance.  Strategy: Short Straddle (28th November 2019 contract)  Considering the expiry week and current trading setup, we have adopted quite aggressive theta depreciating strategy in a form of 'Short Straddle' where traders can go short in ATM call and put option and expect to gain the most of the premium amount as the stock is likely to close near Rs 330 at the time of expiration. Due to monthly expiry week, the risk can be minimized by placing a stop loss at breakeven points as the premiums would be trading almost at intrinsic value for ITM options.  Sell Rs 330 Call option at Rs 5.65 Sell Rs 330 Put option at Rs 6.50  Call delta&nbsp;and&nbsp;theta 0.49&nbsp;and -0.57 Put delta and theta -0.51 and -0.60  Maximum profit - Rs 12.15 Upper breakeven - Rs 342.15 Lower breakeven - Rs 317.85  Stop loss can be placed at the breakeven points.

","Largest lender SBI does not &amp;quot;mind&amp;quot; its lower stock valuation compared to leaner private sector players due to state ownership and social sector focus, but admitted that it needs to improve on commercial decisions.  Speaking at an event organised by former Sebi chief M Damodaran here on November 21, Arijit Basu, a managing director at SBI, also conceded that the bank has erred on some business decisions and cannot attribute those to social compulsions.  SBI's market capitalisation on Friday stood at a low Rs 2.95 lakh crore, which is just about 42 percent of private sector HDFC Bank's Rs 7.02 lakh crore, while SBI's loan-book is Rs 22.48 lakh crore, and the same for HDFC Bank is under Rs 9 lakh crore.  &amp;quot;If our market cap is slightly lower...we do not mind that.

He, however, conceded that some commercial decisions taken by the bank in the past decade have been wrong and it cannot blame the social sector mandates for such decisions.  &amp;quot;On the commercial part, as a bank we feel that there is scope to improve. While there have been ecosystem problems, we would be foolish to state that in the last 10 years, we have not made mistakes in our business itself as those were taken with no social compulsion at all,&amp;quot; he added.  Basu said there are also some benefits of the societal outlook of SBI, saying it helps it access low cost deposits, and that the market rewards the bank when it does good commercially like the recent spike in valuations after a favourable judgement in the Essar Steel case.","Business,India,SBI,State Bank of India",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/sbi-admits-to-making-many-poor-commercial-decisions_13204361.html

It has been over two months since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) restricted cash withdrawals for PMC Bank customers, who are under dire stress. Customers of Dewan Housing Finance Corp (DHFL) have also not been able to access their fixed deposits and are awaiting some relief.  Customers across other financial entities, be it public, private, cooperative as well as non-bank categories are now questioning the stability of their banks. Retirees being the most concerned as the events have left them worrying about their life's savings.  &amp;quot;We are seeing a lot of deposit inflow from customers who are retired and had all their savings with a cooperative bank or a non- bank.&nbsp;They are now opting for safety over a few percentage points of higher deposit rates,&amp;quot; said a senior official of State Bank of India, the country's largest lender.  Typically, cooperative banks and deposit taking non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) offer higher interest rates on savings and fixed-term deposit accounts compared to large commercial banks. For instance, while commercial banks pay around 6.25-6.5 percent for one-year term deposits, cooperative banks are offering around 7.5-8 percent on the similar maturity.  Other than retirees, salaried individuals who have to maintain accounts with one particular lender due to corporate arrangement, are also opening accounts with other banks they feel are safe.  &amp;quot;After the PMC Bank incident, one thing is clear that its not safe to keep all your eggs in the same basket. The deposit insurance is also only Rs 1 lakh as of now,&amp;quot; said an IT employee who holds a salary account with a private lender.  In another instance, shareholders of a medium-sized pharmceutical company demanded the management to shift the company's accounts from a cooperative bank to a larger commercial bank. The issue took centre stage at the company's annual general meeting, with the management agreeing to look into carrying out the stakeholders' wishes.  The RBI has increased cash withdrawal limit for PMC Bank customers to Rs 40,000 in four tranches since September and is working with the government to bring about changes in the way cooperative banks are regulated. However, in two months much has changed for its customers.  For instance, a senior citizen whose tailoring business relied upon her account with the PMC Bank, saw it crumbling down to pieces due to non-availability of operational funds and letter of guarantee. As a result, she lost her clients as well as employees who found work elsewhere during the busy festive and wedding season.  &amp;quot;How do you expect an old widow to stand up on her feet again?&amp;quot; she said, fighting back tears. Her efforts to immediately move her business to a large private bank also hit a roadblock as they demanded a No Objection Certificate (NOC) against an overdraft facility with her previous lender that is taking too long to process. She also had fixed deposits worth Rs 20 lakh with PMC Bank which are not accessible at the moment.  While authorities are working towards ending the depositors' suffering as soon as possible, it will take longer to reinstate the confidence and trust customers had in banks. Improved supervision to keep a check on frauds and hike in the deposit insurance limits are expected to be the first few steps in the right direction.","Business,cash withdrawal,depositors' money,India,PMC Bank crisis,RBI",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/pmc-bank-crisis-aftermath-depositors39-confidencebanks-takesbig-knock_13191801.html

So instead of waiting for the exact time when upside will start opening up, investors should keep investing in every decline all through the year for harvesting in future years","There are not much of leveraged positions by traders in the market. So probability for any big correction in 2019 appears low. 2019 is more of an accumulation phase for harvesting thereafter,&nbsp;Shailendra Kumar,&nbsp;Chief Investment Officer,&nbsp;Narnolia Financial Advisors&nbsp;said in an interview to Moneycontrol's Sunil Shankar Matkar.  Edited excerpts:  Q. Auto stocks corrected significantly in 2018 and now Maruti Suzuki, Eicher Motors, Tata Motors December sales numbers added to investors disappointment. What is your expectation from the space in 2019?  A. December is cyclically a weak month for auto sales. This time it got even worse as dealers were carrying large stocks after poor festival season sales. Rural demand had been a strong driver for auto volume post GST related trade channel disruption but there are concerns building up there.  At the same time, high competition in the marketplace negates the possibility of price rise barring some on account of new emission norms. Going forward auto volume growth will remain in single digits only and pricing growth too will be absent. The saving grace for the sector would be margin revival if commodity prices remain benign.  Q. Do you foresee any big correction in 2019 after a positive close in 2018? What risks should investors stay wary of in 2019?  A. There are steady domestic inflows through mutual fund routes and that gives stability to this market. This fresh buying by retail investors is large enough to negate any sells that may be triggered by foreign investors on account of global concern in 2019.  Also, there are not much of leveraged positions by traders in the market. So probability for any big correction in 2019 appears low. Our base hypothesis for 2019 is that the volatility will fall in the second half of the calendar year and return would be benign but positive. Our near-term target for Nifty is 11,800. 2019 is more of an accumulation phase for harvesting thereafter.  Q. Analysts suggest public capex could continue next year due to general elections but private capex pickup will take time. What is your take on capex?  A. We are not seeing any such incrementally large move this time. The government would be tilting more towards some direct transfer scheme to appease voters than improving sentiments using infra capex.  Private capex is surely in a take-off mode as capacity utilisation has improved and post demonetisation and GST implementation related initial weakness, demand outlook is again improving.  Q. Which among&nbsp;largecap,&nbsp;midcap and smallcap will do good in 2019?  A. 2019 will prove to be a very neutral year in terms of various sub-segments of the market. Earnings growth of various cap, sector or themes will be very similar in 2019. Valuation differential, too, has narrowed for various sub-segments of the market.  And these two factors that mean that portfolio return this year would be more a function of stock selection skill than the exposure to a particular segment.  Q. Gold and real estate are getting few takers now. Does this mean more domestic money will flow into equity and fixed income during 2019? Also, what is your take on FII investment?  A. Falling real estate price and tepid return in gold over last 4-5 years has surely contributed to this current switch in preference for financial saving over physical savings. But still, financial savings as a percentage of total savings of an average Indian household remains low and so this trend should continue.  In terms of foreign portfolio investment, 2018 was one of the worst years. Along with equity, large outflow has happened from the debt market. But the trend should reverse as the basic reason for FII outflow- rising crude and strengthening US dollar have both reversed.  Q. After a lacklustre performance over the last few years, will capital goods be a theme for 2019?  A. The current environment is incrementally positive for capital goods companies. Investment cycle, after being down for almost five years, is showing signs of revival. Also, most of the capital goods companies are trading near their cyclical low valuation.  Q. What should investors do given general elections, global growth concerns, expected US Fed rate hikes, falling crude oil prices and hope of domestic interest rate cut in 2019?  A. Global growth and interest rate environment will remain benign. Europe is where the source of global downside risk exists but as of now it looks contained. Domestically any disruption that further delays earning revival of Indian corporate is a key concern. But the probability of these risk events happening is low. So return looks limited but risks if any, is mostly on the upside.  2019 is an accumulation year. So instead of waiting for the exact time when upside will start opening up, investors should keep investing in every decline all through the year for harvesting in future years.  Q. What are your top five bets for 2019?

The consortium of banks on January 8 met Jet Airways' officials,&nbsp;including founder and Chairman Naresh Goyal and a representative of Etihad Airways, which holds a 24 percent stake in the airline, to discuss&nbsp;its financial state.  If the stakeholders approve the proposed turnaround plan, Goyal may have to dilute his stake from the existing 51 percent.&nbsp;Lenders are of the view that Goyal must step down from Jet Airways' board, however he could continue to be associated with the airline in a non-executive capacity, according to a report by Business Standard.  &amp;quot;The conversation is around reducing Goyal's say in operating the airline,&amp;quot; a source told the paper. As per the report, Goyal's stake may be halved and SBI would hold over 20 percent stake in the airline.  Read |&nbsp;Lenders seek an update on Jet Airways' liquidity situation: Report  Media reports suggest that one of Goyal's family members could replace him on the board.  &amp;quot;While the finer details are still being worked upon, the broader contours entail that Goyal and Etihad will together infuse $450 million in the company, while the Indian lenders will restructure another $450 million of the airline's debt, which is up for maturity between now and March,&amp;quot; a source told Mint.  Read: Jet Airways' survival may rest on founder Naresh Goyal leaving the cockpit  The final plan is said to be put in place by January end and lenders are hopeful that the resolution plan will be in force by March 31, which is well within the 180-day period set by Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) in its February 12 circular, the Mint report stated.  Lenders, however, will not release cash until they have a look at the forensic audit report by&nbsp;EY&nbsp;on Jet Airways' business viability, according to a The Times of India&nbsp;report.&nbsp;SBI has&nbsp;appointed EY to conduct a forensic audit into Jet Airways' books from April 1, 2014, to March 31, 2018. The process is underway.  &amp;quot;The lenders have also assured Jet Airways' vendors and lessors that their dues will be cleared in three tranches till April, by which time the lenders expect the payment cycle to become regular,&amp;quot; another source told Mint, adding that as part of the restructuring, lenders have also proposed a moratorium on repayments on loan facilities which are due till April.  Read&nbsp;| Quick Take: Can Jet Airways avoid a crash landing?  Etihad Airways is said to have offered to guarantee loans worth $150 million for Jet Airways to keep the airline operational. According to estimates,&nbsp;it needs close to $500 million between now and April to meet repayment obligations and manage operating expenses.  The airline defaulted on a debt payment to a consortium of banks led by&nbsp;SBI on January 1. It reported three consecutive quarterly losses of over Rs 1,000 crore each since the quarter ended March 2018.  Jet Airways&nbsp;has been planning to raise money from the market to repay debt and fund its operations.  Read &mdash; Jet Airways close to securing Rs 1,500 crore loan from SBI: Sources  In September 2018, the airline had&nbsp;informed its overseas lenders that it would raise about Rs 3,500 crore over six months through a stake sale in its loyalty programme &mdash; Jet Privilege &mdash; and infuse fresh funds into the company. However, the airline is yet to find fresh funds or monetise its stake in its loyalty programme.  Jet Airways has been undertaking cost-cutting measures such as shutting services on unviable routes and moving towards a no-frills airline by stopping free meals. The management had earlier said it intends to cut its operating cost by Rs 2,000 crore over the next two years. These measures may, however,&nbsp;take a few more quarters to&nbsp;bear significant results.","Business,Companies,Current Affairs,Jet Airways,Naresh Goyal-promoted Jet Airways,video",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/jet-airways39-lenders-propose-36900m-turnaround-plan-naresh-goyal39s-stake-may-halve-to-about-26-report_11928041.html

This is more than 80 percent of its group debt,&amp;quot; the company said in a statement.  Sources told&nbsp;Moneycontrol the group debt is at about Rs 35,000 crore after the latest repayment.  Essar Global repaid approximately Rs 6,300 crore to ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Standard Chartered Bank. &amp;quot;With this, these banks have been repaid their entire facility of Rs 31,500 crore, which they had provided to Essar Global to fund its capital expenditure programme in 2008-14,&amp;quot; the statement said.  Russia's VTB is the only continuing lender to Essar Global.  The latest deleveraging happens after a major round in 2017, in which Essar Global paid back Rs 86,000 crore of liabilities after the sale of Essar Oil to a consortium led by Rosneft.  The Group later also sold its business outsourcing business, Aegis, for Rs 6,000 crore, and&nbsp;Equinox Business Parks to Brookfield Asset Management for Rs 2,400 crore.  Essar's steel business, which has a debt of Rs 45,000 crore, is now in the insolvency courts. While ArcelorMittal has made a bid of Rs 42,000 crore, the Ruias have submitted a proposal of Rs 54,389 crore.  The Essar Group at present has annual revenues of $11.5 billion, with a presence in sectors such as energy, infrastructure and metals &amp;amp;amp; mining.  A comeback in Minnesota?  The holding company also announced it had come to a settlement with &amp;quot;all lenders who had provided debt facilities to erstwhile Essar Steel Minnesota Ltd and were beneficiaries of unsecured guarantees from Essar Global.&amp;quot;  The lenders include ICICI Bank and&nbsp;State Bank of India.  Essar Global had acquired Minnesota Steel in 2007, giving it access to rich iron ore reserves. But a commodity slowdown and delay in projects led Essar Steel Minnesota to file for bankruptcy in 2016. The firm was later taken out of bankruptcy by Mesabi Metallics in 2017. But there were several claims on the project.  In the latest move, Essar Global&nbsp;has purchased $260 million face value notes issued by Mesabi Metallics Inc. &amp;quot;These notes substantially constitute all of the debt of Mesabi, and paves the way for Essar Global&nbsp;to once again participate in the low-cost iron ore mining and pellet manufacturing project that is under construction in Minnesota, USA,&amp;quot; the company said.  While a source confirmed Essar Global will be &amp;quot;soon back&amp;quot; in Minnesota,&nbsp; he declined to give more details.","Business,Companies",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/essar-global-repays-rs-12000-cr-debt-makes-comebackminnesota-iron-ore-mining-project_11920161.html

Elara is one of the brokerage houses that also turned positive on banks and expects better days ahead for lenders.  &amp;quot;We expect banks' profitability to improve after a long hiatus based on a few factors: 1) traction in credit expansion pace, 2) much better loan pricing power considering weak financial condition of key competitor (NBFC), 3) a fall in G-Sec yield, and 4) improvement in NPL recoveries by up-gradation of Jayaswal Neco, Binani Cements and Uttam Galva loan accounts,&amp;quot; Elara said.  It believes higher credit growth would reflect into banks' market share gain and loan pricing power would enhance margin. &amp;quot;A fall in G-Sec yield would result in higher capital gains and write-back of MTM depreciation on fixed-income papers.&amp;quot;  The absence of chunky corporate loan slippages and NPL recoveries in NCLT/IBC cases apart from other recoveries would lead to a&nbsp;rise in provisions buffer and adjusted book value, it said.  Post IL&amp;amp;amp;FS debacle, NBFCs' resources mobilisation and pace of lending have undergone major adjustments. Although large banks are equipped with excess SLR (statutory liquidity ratio) and core capital, lending to NBFCs was limited. Banks opened tap only after RBI and government intervention.  As a result of this, Elara said credit demand has shifted to banks with much better pricing power. &amp;quot;This will eventually translate into higher margin for the banks.&amp;quot;  The research house does not expect any new large corporate loan account to slip barring re-classification of IL&amp;amp;amp;FS.  It said a sharp fall of 65bp (to 7.37 percent) in 10-year benchmark G-sec in Q3FY19 QoQ would lead to a sizable capital gain and investment depreciation write-back. It expects investment depreciation write-back at 30-35 percent of average PPOP (pre-provision operating profit) in Q1 and Q2.  Elara feels among the large PSBs, SBI would be an outlier in terms of outperformance and among mid-sized PSBs, Syndicate Bank would be an outlier. Their MTM write-backs would be at 52 percent and around 110 percent of their average PPOP. Treasury gains would also improve substantially, it said.  Hence, considering these factors, the research house prefers banks with high core capital to take advantage of traction in credit demand and higher low-cost deposit to contain funding cost and remain competitive in loan pricing.  Overall, it prefers ICICI Bank (Accumulate - Target Rs 363), Axis Bank (Accumulate - Target Rs 648) and SBI (Accumulate - Target Rs 323) among corporate banks and Karur Vysya Bank (Buy - Target Rs 111) and City Union Bank (Buy - Target Rs 212) among mid-sized regional banks.
