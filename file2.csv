SBI,2023-07-10T17:02:09+05:30,"{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}",What can investors expect from banks&rsquo; Q1 earnings?,The Street expects the net interest margins to be under pressure as repo rate hikes by the RBI have been paused but deposit cost increase is catching up.,"FY23 was a solid year for banks amid robust loan demand, comfortable asset quality and improvement in return ratios. While the trend is expected to continue in Q1 FY24, analysts say banks may see a marginally weak quarter due to lower net interest margins and higher provisions as the June quarter usually sees agri delinquencies.  The Street expects the net interest margins (NIMs) &ndash; a key metric for lenders -- to be under pressure as repo rate hikes by the RBI have been paused but deposit cost increase is catching up.  NIM is a measure of the difference between the money that a bank earns from interest on loans and the amount it is paying in interest on deposits. That said, investors can take heart from recent RBI data which showed credit growth has been holding up well, while non-performing assets have slumped to a decadal low.  RBI Financial Stability Report: Banks see jump in credit, deposit in 2023  Credit growth, which has been rising since early 2022, led by both public sector banks (PSBs) and private banks, stood at 15.4 percent on June 2, 2023, as per RBI&rsquo;s Financial Stability Report (FSR) released on June 28.  The deposits growth, which declined in 2021-22 and early 2022-23, stood at 11.8 percent as on June 2, 2023.  Credit growth was boosted by agriculture, services and personal loans, which grew faster than those for the industrial sector.  Personal loans recorded a growth of 22.2 percent, wherein all major segments such as housing, credit card receivables, vehicle/ auto loans&nbsp;and education loans registered robust expansion.  &ldquo;Deposits are gathering momentum as deposit rates have been hiked. As at 23rd June&rsquo;23, deposits grew by 12.1 percent YoY compared to 9.8 percent in March &rsquo;23,&rdquo; analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher said.  Current accounts and saving accounts (CASA) &ndash; the cheapest source of funds for banks -- are expected to decline by 1.1 percent QoQ while CASA ratio could fall from 42.7 percent to 41.3 percent, they added.  &ldquo;For our coverage banks, yield on assets is expected to improve by 23 bps QoQ while cost of funds could rise by 34 bps. Hence, NIM is expected to fall by 8 bps QoQ to 3.84 percent,&rdquo; the domestic brokerage said.  Metrics Matrix  While the Indian banking sector has shown remarkable improvement in asset quality over the past few years, the first quarter of FY2024 can see a slight dip.  &ldquo;Due to seasonal spike in agri slippages, we expect gross slippages to rise ~10% QoQ (off low base), but see ~12% decline YoY for our coverage private banks,&rdquo; ICICI Securities said in a recent note, adding that it sees no material corporate slippages (including aviation sector).  For India's largest lender SBI,&nbsp;ICICI Securities is&nbsp;modelling in almost 2x gross slippages QoQ led by agri slippages.  Concerns on the agri front have been voiced by other experts as well.  &ldquo;Asset quality is expected to see a slight blip and slippage ratio could rise from 1.26% to 1.46%, driven by agri slippages especially in case of SBI and HDFC Bank,&rdquo; Prabhudas Lilladher said, adding Q1 usually sees agri delinquencies.  Also Read:&nbsp;How big a role does the monsoon play in India&rsquo;s agricultural production?  However, beyond the agri space, analysts do not see much NPA stress for banks, though the trend remains to be seen amid elevated interest rates.  &ldquo;We do not expect any adverse commentary on asset quality, apart from indications on the unsecured portfolio. Given high inflation and rate hikes, we await management commentary on business and lower income strata. Historically, there has been a low correlation on rates and asset quality, which took a hit from excesses created in the system, and there are no signs of that as on yet. We expect strong asset quality trends to sustain,&rdquo; Elara Capital said.  As per RBI data, Indian banks&rsquo; gross NPA ratio declined to 3.9 percent in March 2023 &ndash; a 10-year low. The net NPA ratio of the scheduled commercial banks also improved to 1.0 percent, a level last observed in June 2011.  During 2022-23, NIMs improved by 30 bps as the transmission of monetary policy tightening to deposit rates lagged that of lending. The banks&rsquo; profit after tax (PAT) recorded a robust growth of 38.4 per cent (y-o-y) during last fiscal, driven by a strong increase in net interest income (NII) and lower provisions.  In terms of top picks, Elara Capital prefers ICICI Bank, Axis Bank,&nbsp;IndusInd&nbsp;Bank and SBI in the large-cap space as balance sheet heft and digital nimbleness give them an edge over mid-sized ones.  &amp;quot;Among midcap banks, we favour Federal&nbsp;Bank and Karur Vysya Bank and expect structural challenges in regional banks,&amp;quot; it added.  In a note to clients, Emkay Global said&nbsp;ICICI Bank remains&nbsp;its top pick, though the stock momentum has been limited due to concerns around rising&nbsp;key management personnel (KMO) attrition/movement.  &amp;quot;Notwithstanding near-term business dislocation due to the merger, we believe HDFC Bank should be back in the game from H2, while Kotak&rsquo;s nearing top management change should keep it under pressure,&amp;quot; it added.

Today, the Nifty and Sensex turned volatile","The Monetary Policy Committee has maintained&nbsp;the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent in its bi-monthly review, while continuing to keep a close vigil on the evolving inflation and growth outlook.  Five of the six-member committee voted in favour of maintaining withdrawal of accommodation stance to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth.  The interest rate decision by MPC is on expected lines, though few experts were expecting a possibility of change in policy stance to neutral.  The MPC took note of the moderation in CPI headline inflation in March-April into the tolerance band, in line with projections, reflecting the combined impact of monetary tightening and supply augmenting measures.  Headline inflation is projected to decline in 2023-24 from its level in 2022-23 but would still be above the target, warranting continuous vigil, said the RBI, adding the progress of the south west monsoon is critical in this regard.  The central bank lowered its FY24 inflation projection to 5.1 percent from 5.2 percent earlier, and also to 4.6 percent from 5.1 percent for Q1FY24 and to 5.2 percent against 5.4 percent for Q2FY24.  &amp;quot;As the RBI expects inflation to remain within its target range for the rest of the fiscal year, and with growth faring reasonably well, we think the RBI will stay on hold through the rest of FY24,&amp;quot; Rahul Bajoria, MD and Head of EM Asia (ex-China) Economics at Barclays, said.  RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his policy address emphasised the need to bring down the CPI inflation to its 4 percent target consistently, saying that inflation being within the tolerance band itself was &ldquo;not good enough&rdquo;, Rahul pointed out.  The cumulative rate hike of 250 basis points undertaken by the MPC is transmitting through the economy and its fuller impact should keep inflationary pressures contained in the coming months, the RBI said.  Also read:&nbsp;Market in see-saw mode post-RBI policy, here are the key factors at play  The central bank has maintained its current financial year growth projection at 6.5 percent, while expecting the real GDP growth for Q1FY24 at 8 percent and 6.5 percent for Q2FY24.

Core credit cost stood at 16 bps vs. 21 bps q-o-q and 49 bps y-o-y. However, core PPoP growth (up 17% y-o-y/ 2% q-o-q) moderated, led by higher opex growth (27% y-o-y/22% q-o-q) despite strong revenue growth.

PCR at ~76% was stable q-o-q. The bank is positioned well to handle any incremental burden on account of ECL provisions, if any, as it already has non-NPA provisions of ~1.1% of loans outside PCR.

Going forward, the bank expects growth to moderate to 12-14% in FY24 from 17% in FY23, but continued traction in the retail portfolio, along with MCLR repricing and LDR improvement, should support margins. Bank has not indicated any net ECL shortfall, but our workings suggest a likely shortfall of ~1% of loans under the Base stress case which, though, looks easily manageable.

Bank claims that it is in no hurry to raise capital, given the strong internal accruals.

SBI is a sector proxy that benefits from its strong liability franchise and continued favourable sector tailwinds.

Upside risk to margins persists &ndash; a) Transmission of MCLR rates (~185 bps passed on till now vs. 250 bps rate hike) on corporate loans is yet to happen, which provides sufficient headroom for NIM expansion, offsetting any increase in cost of deposits and b) delay in rate hike pause.

","State Bank of India&nbsp;on February 3 reported a 68 percent surge in net profit for the December quarter, beating Street expectations by a big margin. The net profit was boosted by a reduction in provisions and strong core income growth.  India&rsquo;s largest lender reported a net profit of Rs 14,205 crore for the December quarter, up from Rs 8,431.9 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. A poll of eight brokerages had estimated the net profit at Rs 13,360 crore for the quarter.  SBI&rsquo;s net interest income, the core income it earns from its lending operations, rose 24 percent year-on-year to Rs 38,069 crore for the December quarter. Analysts polled by Moneycontrol had estimated the NII to be Rs 36,948 crore. The NII growth was lifted by a strong loan book expansion.  ALSO READ: FM Sitharaman on Adani: LIC, SBI exposure to group within permissible limits  The lender&rsquo;s interest income rose to Rs 86,616 crore from Rs 69,678 crore in the same quarter of the previous year.  Provisions declined 17 percent to Rs 5,760 crore in the December quarter. The state-owned lender's provisions totalled Rs 6,974 crore in the same period last year. Loan loss provisioning, or provisions towards bad loans, dropped a big 49 percent to Rs 1,586 crore.  Growth engines fire  The bank&rsquo;s loan book grew 17.60 percent and the expansion was led by retail loans that grew by 18 percent year-on-year. Within retail, housing loans showed a growth of 14 percent and had the largest share in retail loans. The fastest growing segments, though, were unsecured personal loans and gold loans. Chairman Dinesh Khara sounded optimistic over credit growth in the coming quarters but added that the pace may moderate a bit.  ALSO READ:  SBI&rsquo;s corporate loan book too saw a similar expansion of 18 percent. Within corporate loan book, lending to roads and ports in infrastructure, iron and steel sector and services grew the fastest during the quarter.&nbsp; &ldquo;We expect growth will be somewhere between 14-16 percent for FY23,&rdquo; said Khara in a press interaction post quarterly results.  Deposit growth was far slower than credit growth at 9.5 percent to Rs 42.13 crore for the December quarter. The share of low-cost current and savings account deposit declined marginally as depositors shifted towards term deposits which grew by 11.38 percent year-on-year. Khara said that deposit growth is comfortable enough to ensure the loan book growth isn&rsquo;t hampered. &ldquo;As of now we are comfortably placed to ensure that we are able to support balance sheet growth on loans,&rdquo; he said.  When asked about whether interest rates on government schemes would impact deposit mobilisation, Khara said, &ldquo;we are quite mindful of competition and we should be offering the deals to counter.&rdquo;  Asset quality  SBI&rsquo;s asset quality showed significant improvement in the December quarter and its gross bad loan ratio dropped to 3.14 percent from 4.50 percent a year ago. On a net basis, the share of bad loans in total loan book dropped to 0.77 percent from 1.34 percent a year ago.  The stress of the loan book is largely from agriculture that had a gross bad loan ratio of 12.03 percent. About 4 percent of corporate loans were non-performing and the ratio for retail loans was 3.24 percent.  However, fresh slippages increased to Rs 3,098 crore in the December quarter, from 2334 crore a year ago. Upgrades and recoveries too faltered, totalling Rs 1,643 crore, lower than 2,306 crore a year ago and far lower than Rs 5,207 crore in the previous quarter. The reduction in gross bad loans seem to have largely come from write-offs.  The bank&rsquo;s special mention accounts that capture initial signs of stress has come down. SMA 1 and 2 accounts that capture repayments due for thirty days and more were down to Rs 4,747 crore from Rs 8,497 crore in the previous quarter.","Results,State Bank of India",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/results/sbi-q3-result-net-profit-surges-68-to-rs-14205-crore-beats-estimates_16845301.html
