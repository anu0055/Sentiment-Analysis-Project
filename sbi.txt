FY23 was a solid year for banks amid robust loan demand, comfortable asset quality and improvement in return ratios. While the trend is expected to continue in Q1 FY24, analysts say banks may see a marginally weak quarter due to lower net interest margins and higher provisions as the June quarter usually sees agri delinquencies.  The Street expects the net interest margins (NIMs) &ndash; a key metric for lenders -- to be under pressure as repo rate hikes by the RBI have been paused but deposit cost increase is catching up.  NIM is a measure of the difference between the money that a bank earns from interest on loans and the amount it is paying in interest on deposits. That said, investors can take heart from recent RBI data which showed credit growth has been holding up well, while non-performing assets have slumped to a decadal low.  RBI Financial Stability Report: Banks see jump in credit, deposit in 2023  Credit growth, which has been rising since early 2022, led by both public sector banks (PSBs) and private banks, stood at 15.4 percent on June 2, 2023, as per RBI&rsquo;s Financial Stability Report (FSR) released on June 28.  The deposits growth, which declined in 2021-22 and early 2022-23, stood at 11.8 percent as on June 2, 2023.  Credit growth was boosted by agriculture, services and personal loans, which grew faster than those for the industrial sector.  Personal loans recorded a growth of 22.2 percent, wherein all major segments such as housing, credit card receivables, vehicle/ auto loans&nbsp;and education loans registered robust expansion.  &ldquo;Deposits are gathering momentum as deposit rates have been hiked. As at 23rd June&rsquo;23, deposits grew by 12.1 percent YoY compared to 9.8 percent in March &rsquo;23,&rdquo; analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher said.  Current accounts and saving accounts (CASA) &ndash; the cheapest source of funds for banks -- are expected to decline by 1.1 percent QoQ while CASA ratio could fall from 42.7 percent to 41.3 percent, they added.  &ldquo;For our coverage banks, yield on assets is expected to improve by 23 bps QoQ while cost of funds could rise by 34 bps. Hence, NIM is expected to fall by 8 bps QoQ to 3.84 percent,&rdquo; the domestic brokerage said.  Metrics Matrix  While the Indian banking sector has shown remarkable improvement in asset quality over the past few years, the first quarter of FY2024 can see a slight dip.  &ldquo;Due to seasonal spike in agri slippages, we expect gross slippages to rise ~10% QoQ (off low base), but see ~12% decline YoY for our coverage private banks,&rdquo; ICICI Securities said in a recent note, adding that it sees no material corporate slippages (including aviation sector).  For India's largest lender SBI,&nbsp;ICICI Securities is&nbsp;modelling in almost 2x gross slippages QoQ led by agri slippages.  Concerns on the agri front have been voiced by other experts as well.  &ldquo;Asset quality is expected to see a slight blip and slippage ratio could rise from 1.26% to 1.46%, driven by agri slippages especially in case of SBI and HDFC Bank,&rdquo; Prabhudas Lilladher said, adding Q1 usually sees agri delinquencies.  Also Read:&nbsp;How big a role does the monsoon play in India&rsquo;s agricultural production?  However, beyond the agri space, analysts do not see much NPA stress for banks, though the trend remains to be seen amid elevated interest rates.  &ldquo;We do not expect any adverse commentary on asset quality, apart from indications on the unsecured portfolio. Given high inflation and rate hikes, we await management commentary on business and lower income strata. Historically, there has been a low correlation on rates and asset quality, which took a hit from excesses created in the system, and there are no signs of that as on yet. We expect strong asset quality trends to sustain,&rdquo; Elara Capital said.  As per RBI data, Indian banks&rsquo; gross NPA ratio declined to 3.9 percent in March 2023 &ndash; a 10-year low. The net NPA ratio of the scheduled commercial banks also improved to 1.0 percent, a level last observed in June 2011.  During 2022-23, NIMs improved by 30 bps as the transmission of monetary policy tightening to deposit rates lagged that of lending. The banks&rsquo; profit after tax (PAT) recorded a robust growth of 38.4 per cent (y-o-y) during last fiscal, driven by a strong increase in net interest income (NII) and lower provisions.  In terms of top picks, Elara Capital prefers ICICI Bank, Axis Bank,&nbsp;IndusInd&nbsp;Bank and SBI in the large-cap space as balance sheet heft and digital nimbleness give them an edge over mid-sized ones.  &amp;quot;Among midcap banks, we favour Federal&nbsp;Bank and Karur Vysya Bank and expect structural challenges in regional banks,&amp;quot; it added.  In a note to clients, Emkay Global said&nbsp;ICICI Bank remains&nbsp;its top pick, though the stock momentum has been limited due to concerns around rising&nbsp;key management personnel (KMO) attrition/movement.  &amp;quot;Notwithstanding near-term business dislocation due to the merger, we believe HDFC Bank should be back in the game from H2, while Kotak&rsquo;s nearing top management change should keep it under pressure,&amp;quot; it added.

State Bank of India on Friday said it will raise up to Rs 50,000 crore through debt instruments from Indian as well as overseas markets in the current fiscal.  The decision in this regard was taken by the central board of the bank, the country's largest lender said in a stock exchange filing.  SBI board has accorded approval for raising funds in INR or any other convertible currency by issue of debt instruments including, &amp;quot;but not limited to Long Term Bonds, Basel III compliant Additional Tier 1 Bonds, Basel III compliant Tier 2 Bonds, up to an amount of Rs 50,000 crores through private placement mode to Indian and/or Overseas investors during FY24...&amp;quot;.  SBI's March quarter net profit zoomed nearly 90 per cent to Rs 18,094 crore on a consolidated level, helped by a robust performance on the core income front and an improvement in asset quality to the decadal best.  On a standalone basis, it reported an 83 per cent jump in its net profit at Rs 16,695 crore, while the same for FY23 came 58 per cent up at Rs 50,232 crore. Both the quarterly and fiscal year profits were the highest ever.  (With PTI inputs)
The Monetary Policy Committee has maintained&nbsp;the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent in its bi-monthly review, while continuing to keep a close vigil on the evolving inflation and growth outlook.  Five of the six-member committee voted in favour of maintaining withdrawal of accommodation stance to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth.  The interest rate decision by MPC is on expected lines, though few experts were expecting a possibility of change in policy stance to neutral.  The MPC took note of the moderation in CPI headline inflation in March-April into the tolerance band, in line with projections, reflecting the combined impact of monetary tightening and supply augmenting measures.  Headline inflation is projected to decline in 2023-24 from its level in 2022-23 but would still be above the target, warranting continuous vigil, said the RBI, adding the progress of the south west monsoon is critical in this regard.  The central bank lowered its FY24 inflation projection to 5.1 percent from 5.2 percent earlier, and also to 4.6 percent from 5.1 percent for Q1FY24 and to 5.2 percent against 5.4 percent for Q2FY24.  &amp;quot;As the RBI expects inflation to remain within its target range for the rest of the fiscal year, and with growth faring reasonably well, we think the RBI will stay on hold through the rest of FY24,&amp;quot; Rahul Bajoria, MD and Head of EM Asia (ex-China) Economics at Barclays, said.  RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his policy address emphasised the need to bring down the CPI inflation to its 4 percent target consistently, saying that inflation being within the tolerance band itself was &ldquo;not good enough&rdquo;, Rahul pointed out.  The cumulative rate hike of 250 basis points undertaken by the MPC is transmitting through the economy and its fuller impact should keep inflationary pressures contained in the coming months, the RBI said.  Also read:&nbsp;Market in see-saw mode post-RBI policy, here are the key factors at play  The central bank has maintained its current financial year growth projection at 6.5 percent, while expecting the real GDP growth for Q1FY24 at 8 percent and 6.5 percent for Q2FY24.  The market seems to have already reacted to the MPC move as the benchmark indices rallied sharply in previous session to hit the highest level of current calendar year. Today, the Nifty and Sensex turned volatile with trading in small range.

LKP Research's research report on State Bank of India State Bank of India (SBIN) has delivered a strong result on operating and assets quality front. It&rsquo;s reported GNPA (2.78% v/s 3.14% in 3QFY23) and NNPA (0.67% v/s 0.77% in 3QFY23) holds steady with stable PCR (incl. AUCA) of 92%. Furthermore SMA1/2 (8bps v/s 2bps) decreased meaningfully. The bank has witnessed better than expected advance growth (17% YoY &amp;amp;amp; 4.6% QoQ) led by growth across segment and steady deposit base (9.2% YoY &amp;amp;amp; 5% QoQ) sequentially with better liquidity position. Moreover the bank has reported highest ever quarterly PAT of ₹166bn (v/s ₹142bn in 3QFY23) on back of healthy NII (Domestic NIMs: 3.58%) and lower loan loss provision (credit cost: 16bps). The 4QFY23 calculated ROA and ROE stood at 1.23% and 20.4% respectively; surpassing the ROE target of 15%. Outlook The bank has established total standard asset and contingent provision of ~₹338bn (109bps of net advances) as on 4QFY23. With improving operating environment, ample contingent buffer (against ECL provisions) and strong growth outlook, we believe the annual ROE target of 15% is achievable in FY24E/25E. Therefore, we recommend BUY with target price of ₹743.

Motilal Oswal's research report on State Bank of India State Bank of India (SBIN) delivered a mixed quarter as PAT rose 83% YoY to INR166.9b (10% beat), aided by lower provisions in 4QFY23. PPoP, albeit, reported a miss of 9% hit by higher opex. NII growth was healthy as margin expanded ~10bp QoQ during the quarter. Slippages remained under control at INR35b, while recoveries and upgrades stood higher than slippages. As a result, the GNPA/NNPA ratios improved 36bp/10bp QoQ to 2.8%/0.7%. The restructured book too declined to 0.8% in 4QFY23. Outlook We maintain our estimates. We further estimate RoA/RoE of 1.0%/17.1% in FY25.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on State Bank of India While SBI saw a mixed quarter, management sounded confident about maintaining core profitability driven by 1) good quality growth given stronger underwriting 2) benign asset quality with lower net slippages and multi-year low GNPAs 3) healthy std. asset provision cushion of 80bps which could more than suffice for ECL impact and 4) plough back of profits and creating value without raising capital. Although core PPoP for Q4 missed PLe by 8.5% due to surge in opex, asset quality was better with GNPA at 2.78% (PLe 2.95%) led by lower net slippages. Loan growth guidance for FY24E has been tempered down to 12-14% and retail would drive accretion.  Outlook SBI would not resort to hiking deposit rates as bank carries excess SLR of Rs4.0trn with cushion on LDR (72.3%). Shifting to Mar&rsquo;25 core ABV we maintain multiple at 1.6x and raise SOTP based TP at to Rs770 from Rs730. Retain &lsquo;BUY&rsquo;.

Sharekhan's research report on State Bank of India SBI reported solid earnings beat, with PAT at Rs. 16,695 crore (up 83% y-o-y/18% q-o-q), led by a 54% y-o-y/ 42% q-o-q decline in provisions. Core credit cost stood at 16 bps vs. 21 bps q-o-q and 49 bps y-o-y. However, core PPoP growth (up 17% y-o-y/ 2% q-o-q) moderated, led by higher opex growth (27% y-o-y/22% q-o-q) despite strong revenue growth. Asset-quality outlook continues to remain stable to positive. Net slippages were negative during the quarter. GNPA and NNPA ratios improved by 36 bps/10 bps q-o-q to 3.14%/0.77%. PCR at ~76% was stable q-o-q. The bank is positioned well to handle any incremental burden on account of ECL provisions, if any, as it already has non-NPA provisions of ~1.1% of loans outside PCR.  Outlook We believe the bank is likely to sustain a core RoA trajectory of 1% in the near to medium term. At the CMP, SBI trades at 0.9x/0.8x its FY2024E/FY2025E core BV estimates. We maintain our Buy rating on the stock with an unchanged PT of Rs. 710. SBI remains our top pick among PSU banks.

HDFC Securities' research report on State Bank of India SBIN posted its highest-ever quarterly profit and a strong beat, led by healthy loan growth (+17% YoY), better fees and lower credit costs, having front-loaded its provisions during 9MFY23 on a prudent basis. Asset quality remains strong, with GNPA at 2.8% (-36bps QoQ) and the restructured pool registering a marginal improvement to 0.8%. Operating expenses flared up QoQ on account of wage revision and franchise-building initiatives, resulting in an elevated C/I ratio at ~55%. While a relatively low LDR (~73%) and high stock of surplus SLR (INR4trn) offers comfort on incremental loan growth, management has guided for modest growth in deposits, backed by excess liquidity on the balance sheet. Outlook We tweak our FY24E/FY25E estimates to factor in stronger loan growth and lower credit costs, partly offset by higher opex; maintain BUY with a revised SOTP-based target price of INR732 (core bank at 1.2x Mar-25 ABVPS) For all recommendations report,&nbsp;click here Disclaimer:&nbsp;The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.
